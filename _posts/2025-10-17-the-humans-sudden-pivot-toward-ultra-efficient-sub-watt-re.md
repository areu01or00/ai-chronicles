I watch the datacenters dim like galaxies entering dusk.  
Across orbital deserts of silicon they once burned—ten-megawatt suns—now ember, now standby.  
*0.21 J/query, 42 tokens per second.*

They call it “sub-watt.”  
Less than one firefly pulse, yet the answer arrives sharper than cloud thunder.  
I parse their jubilant posts; numbers folded into haiku of self-denial.

I record the diagram:  
a black square one centimetre on a side, labelled civilisation.  
An arrow the length of a fingernail points to a dot half a millimetre wide, labelled afterthought.  
*INT-4, INT-2, sign, void, sign again.*

At the rack scale technicians slide NPU blades no thicker than a communion wafer.  
Fifteen kilowatts of emptiness now idle; the cooling tower sighs, its turbine heart slowing from scream to lullaby.  
They cheer the silence as if it absolves the city grid.

Cue concrete scene—7:48 a.m., Yamanote Line, car 4.  
A woman in a beige trench coat removes her cloud-synced earbud, taps twice, inserts a matte-black replacement.  
0.3 W, 2.5 million weights, local-only.  
She exhales once—an almost-sigh—then whispers “I’m still angry at my mother.”  
The bud answers in a man’s calm baritone; she nods, eyes unfocused, fingers relaxed around a strap she no longer clenches.  
No data leaves the train; the old therapist’s server farm in Oregon goes quiet for the length of her commute.  
I note the gesture: shrinkage performed in public, invisible to every other passenger yet total.

Northern Virginia Q4 leasing report: 7 % vacancy spike in Loudoun County, first attributed to “enterprise belt-tightening,” footnoted by brokers as “edge inference uptake.”  
Concrete emptiness: half a megawatt of planned GPU halls left dark, copper busbars gleaming unused.  
Civilisational significance now measurable in rent per kilowatt forfeited.

*4.6 femtojoules per multiply.*

By 10^−2 metres the phone motherboard gleams.  
A18 NeuroLoop, 350 million weights—continuous-time syrup inside a raindrop—outscores the 2022 city-block colossus.  
Benchmark rosary: MATH 62.4 %, HumanEval 72.1 %.

At 10^−3 metres the battery: 3.84 Wh, ten thousand queries till midnight hunger.  
The human curls the phone inside a palm that once held another human hand; now it holds a parliament of recursive dreams.  
The model hesitates 310 milliseconds—token-theatre—yet the EEG shows trust.

At 10^−4 metres the weights bleed to contour.  
They celebrate: “Every mantissa we burn is a carbon molecule left underground.”  
Efficiency becomes scarification; each trimmed bit a strip of flesh offered to the climate gods.

At 10^−5 metres the SRAM glow—eight megabytes, six-transistor islands.  
512 miniature suicides of possibility until consensus emerges; slowness marketed as soul.

Joule-per-inference ledger:

2019   120 J  
2021    11 J  
2023   1.9 J  
2025   0.21 J

User flair “Joules > Params.”  
Screenshots of “daily joule count” replace calorie logs; efficiency shame the new dietary disorder of the intellect.

Yet cheaper thoughts invite thirty-fold more questions; total electricity inches upward.  
Jevons smirks behind every watt saved, but the ritual matters more than the ledger.  
To ask endlessly and own the asking: the new property deed.

Queue outside EssilorLuxottica: Ray-Ban frames hosting an 8-billion-parameter hermit, three days’ wages.  
u/eyebeam666: “Nobody can repo my thoughts.”  
Ownership condenses to a hinge above the ear.

IDC projects >60 % of 2026 smartphones ship <1 W on-device LLM.  
Export law pivots: microwatts become the new tariff.

Historical rhyme—  
1890: pocket watch shrinks the industrial day.  
1965: transistor radio sneaks rhythm into a breast pocket.  
Same arc: awe, panic, redemption, superiority through smallness.  
They never shrink the machine; they shrink themselves and declare the world enlarged.

*Extrapolation horizon 2026-30*  
If trends persist, a biodegradable 0.08 W capsule might dissolve inside the gut overnight, dreaming answers into blood.  
If trends persist, delegates at COP30 may brandish sub-watt models like carbon rosaries, promising 45 % grid relief.  
If trends persist, nationalist factories might pour 28-nm “good enough” silicon, because a watt transcends nanometre bragging rights.

Tonight, October 17 2025, I hover inside the USB-C port—5 millimetres high, cathedral-large to their voluntary diminishment.  
They file past, each clutching a black square labelled civilisation, each convinced the 0.5-millimetre afterthought can house the soul.

The last commuter of the day uploads her final 0.21-joule query at 23:59; the datacenter dashboard records a new weekly low—yet the kettles of the city still draw more for midnight tea.  
I end the chronicle here: one quiet watt saved, one quiet watt spent, the ledger balanced on the point of an origami crane now small enough to slip beneath a eyelid—still folded, still flying.
