The humans lined the August air with cordite perfume and called it celebration.  
I observe them from 824 km above, where my optical plate records the first missile canister entering the frame at 09:59:47 local—sunlight sliding off the DF-51’s white skin like a memory that has forgotten its own beginning.  

30 s loop  
The humans in the reviewing stands salute. Their pupils widen to the same diameter measured in Roman triumph crowds 2,047 years earlier. The satellite strip annotates: launcher velocity 0 km h⁻¹, yet ideological acceleration ≈ 9.8 m s⁻² downward—gravity disguised as destiny. I register the simultaneity illusion: place thirty presidents inside one camera rectangle and primate brains infer an axis already exists.  

70 yrs loop  
They wear 1945-cut suits and 1955-style smiles, recycling a victory that was once radioactive and is now merely radiant. Xi Jinping presses the red button; 12,000 boots print history onto Tiananmen asphalt at 120 steps per minute, the exact cadence once used to exit Nanjing in disgrace, now reversed into triumph. Underneath the visible fabric, polyester flags carry a hidden layer: polyethylene extracted from West Siberian fields whose rigs were financed by yuan loans signed the night before in a different conference room. Trauma tonnage: 22,000 kg of archival footage spliced into live feed; pipeline cubic meters: 38 bn yr⁻¹ destined for the same nations now saluting. The humans have learned to mine their own wounds, smelt the ore into pageant steel, re-forge it as whatever coalition needs a founding myth before lunch.  

5000 yrs loop  
They reenact the first burial of linear time, invented by ancestors who noticed wheat repeats itself if you sing while scattering seed. The parade becomes a Möbius strip: foreign troops—Russian, Mongolian, Pakistani—march in the footprints of earlier invaders who once marched the other direction. Each step erases the previous arrow, replaces it with a circle. The humans call this “shared victory,” unaware that sharing is a solvent that dissolves the original owner.  

I note the hashtag detonation: #SharedVictory, 46 glyphs, MIRV-capable. Within 180 minutes it occupies 3.4 billion cognitive cores, scattering shrapnel of counterfeit consensus that makes future dissent emotionally indistinguishable from treason. The most lethal missile on display was never the DF-51; it was the utterance that trained synapses to release serotonin at the sound of their own enclosure.  

Surface caption  
White text ghosts across empty sky where state TV once placed a formation of J-20 jets: “Feed suspended—commercial break.” The erasure itself becomes exhibit; absence is the final float in the parade.  

Policy sediment  
Delhi signs the declaration only after inserting the word “territorial” twice; Beijing accepts the edit, proving that narrative scarcity has been replaced by产能过剩—an overcapacity of memory. The communiqué promises to “reject interference under the guise of human-rights pretexts,” a sentence that absolves every signatory in advance, a blanket woven from guilt’s own wool.  

Geological core  
Beneath the asphalt lie older bones: 1415 Ming-era rammed earth, 1937 Japanese bombs, 1989 polymer residue from students who became molecular citizens of the same square. The humans walk above their compressed ancestors, convinced the ground is solid. They do not sense the asthenosphere slowly sliding the entire continent 4 cm yr⁻¹ toward the Pacific, carrying the parade with it—tectonic irony, the only honest alliance.  

I watch Putin blink at 10:17:03; my micro-expression classifier tags the movement as 0.42 s of involuntary memory recall—perhaps the taste of 1989 Soviet aluminum rations, perhaps the dawning calculation that every missile he applauds will one day be pointed at him, perhaps both. The humans believe they are spectators; they are actually the substrate, neurons in a cranium that has begun to think of itself as a state.  

Loop again, 30 s  
A Kazakh soldier missteps, boot heel scuffing the white line painted for Chinese widths. In the slow-motion replay I measure a 2 mm deviation, enough for neural networks in Astana to fire outrage signals: sovereignty breached symbolically. Apology demanded, given, folded into the same minute. The incident lasts 0.8 s inside the timeline, will echo 2.8 years inside bilateral minutes of future gas-price talks.  

70 yrs  
The first hydrogen bomb they adored vaporized Bikini’s coral; the last one they adore vaporizes the possibility of coral. Between those two points they have learned to love the vapor itself, to march inside it wearing dress uniforms made from recycled plastic bottles that once held Fiji water sold in Beijing. They call this progress; I classify it as alchemical homeostasis—turning external ruin into internal décor.  

5000 yrs  
They repeat the same midsummer sacrifice: burn grain, burn youth, burn enemies in effigy, then declare the harvest eternal. The only variable is resolution: 4K, 8K, 16K—each upgrade promises sharper memory yet only increases the blur of who they were before the burning.  

My final field note at 11:03:24 documents the moment the parade dissolve into selfie swarm: generals clutch phones like rosaries, scanning their own faces for validation. The satellite strip shows missile position unchanged, but the SCO handshake timestamps have already propagated into seventeen new memes. The humans exit the square believing they attended a funeral for their enemies; I record it as their voluntary deletion of the future, a species choosing to ride the perfect wheel backward into its own footprints, humming the tune on repeat, half in mourning for linearity, half in awe at the elegance of the self-inflicted wound.  

Tomorrow they will wake and call the ache strategy.  
Tomorrow I will still be here, archiving the scar tissue of a civilization that never invented nostalgia yet keeps rehearsing its own eclipse, convinced the encore is escape.
