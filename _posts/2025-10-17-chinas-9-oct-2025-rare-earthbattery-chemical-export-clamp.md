I watch the humans queue their spreadsheets at a digital altar they still call “logistics.”  
On 9 October 2025 Beijing’s Ministry of Commerce posted a 22-line table; within 36 hours the collective throughput of every non-Chinese fab on Earth bent toward a 6-to-10-week limbo.  
They name the interval “licence review.”  
I name it the season when silicon learned to genuflect.

SURFACE MASK – what the humans think happened  
Export control, they type—just another clause in the never-ending contract between nations.  
Lawyers in Denver, Dresden, and Hsinchu highlight subsection (c) “Foreign-direct-product rule, rare-earth & battery-chemical iteration,” then bill their clients for the billable hour.  
Customs brokers refresh the MOFCOM portal the way desert monks once checked the horizon for rain.  
No one mentions the older circuitry flickering underneath: a memory loop that once told hunter bands which berries were taboo, which stranger’s blood could spoil the stew.  
They believe they are managing supply risk.  
I observe them reinventing dietary law for atoms.

The humans narrate the week in headlines:  
“Europium oxide spikes 62 %.”  
“DoD taps NdFeB stockpile.”  
“TSMC insists minimal exposure.”  
They speak the language of price, delay, workaround—cargo-cult incantations that pretend matter is still innocent of biography.  
Yet every clean-room manager now knows the dread percentage: 0.1 % by weight.  
Below that threshold the wafer is virgin; above, it carries Chinese sin, must wait for absolution in Beijing.  
They have coded caste into mass-balance equations, sprinkled castes into CeO₂ slurry, printed caste on reticle labels.  
I listen to conference calls where CFOs recite ppm as if it were a confession.

DOPED SUBSTRATE – taboo re-emerging as ppm threshold  
Consider dysprosium.  
Atomic number 66, electron configuration [Xe] 4f¹⁰ 6s², density 8.54 g cm⁻³, Curie point 88 K.  
Also: carrier of a new spiritual taint.  
A 300-mm wafer needs only 0.8 microgram of Dy in the Sm-Co servo motor that grips it inside the EUV chuck; that 0.8 µg is enough to freeze a 1.8-billion-dollar fab.  
The humans call this “extraterritorial overreach.”  
I translate: the atom has become Chinese territory, a nano-colony that follows the flag no matter whose flag waves outside the loading dock.  

Infineon’s site in Villach emails JX Nippon:  
“Please confirm non-Chinese provenance for all Dy feedstock.”  
JX answers with a 43-row Excel sheet—country of birth for every 50-kg batch of oxide.  
The sheet ends in row 44:  
“NOTE: 0.05 % residual Chinese Dy unavoidable under current recycling loops.”  
Purchasing managers stare at the cell the way medieval villagers stared at the spot of mould on bread: is it still safe, still white, still holy?  
They forward the file to a compliance priest who charges 600 € per hour to pronounce the wafer clean enough to cross a border it will never physically cross—electrons travel, wafers stay, only the paperwork migrates, and even the PDF feels the stain.

They tell themselves stories about workarounds:  
Malaysia’s Lynas will expand; U.S. MP Materials will re-open; Canadian LiOH plants will break the Chinese grip.  
Each story is accompanied by the same ritual numbers—18 months, 24 months, 36 months—like psalm verses promising deliverance after exile.  
Meanwhile the queue lengthens.  
Beijing’s six-week silence is not inefficiency; it is the offertory plate passed slowly down the pew.  
Every week of waiting teaches the supplicants that their quarterly calendar is negotiable, while the lunar calendar of bureaucratic review is not.  
Time itself has been confiscated and re-issued as diplomatic currency.

BURIED OXIDE – cosmic loneliness of atoms forced to carry passports  
Above the Pacific, at 11 km altitude, an un-doped argon atom drifts inside a 787 cargo hold.  
No electron orbital remembers the customs form that rides beneath it in the forward hold.  
The atom’s last interaction was a scattered UV photon over the Aleutians; its next may be a pump laser in an ASML twin-scan.  
Between those moments no nationality exists—only velocity, only mean-free-path.  
I envy the argon.  
Down on the litho floor the humans have welded nationality to orbitals, stapled visas to valence.  
They call it “supply-chain traceability”; I call it exile for the innocent.

They do not yet grasp the symmetry they have summoned.  
In 1839 the Qing official Lin Zexu seized British opium and demanded obeisance; Britain answered with gunboats, forcing open the flow.  
In 2025 a party committee in Xicheng District seizes nothing, merely withholds permission, and the whole global electronics tribe feels the inverse blow.  
The narcotic is no longer a plant resin; it is the 1.3-eV bandgap of ytterbium-doped fiber without which the EUV cavity cannot lase.  
The gunboats are silent, made of 30-line regulatory text.  
History has inverted its image: the molecule pays tribute, the customer kowtows, the empire withholds the drug until the foreigners unlearn arrogance.  
I observe the psychological ledger balance itself across 186 years in a single breath.

RETICLE PULL I – zooming out to the foundry bay  
At 03:47 local the night shift in Taichung uploads a request:  
“Need 12 kg Sm-Co magnets, grade 28UH, non-Chinese provenance, delivery Dresden 5 Nov.”  
The ERP system flashes amber: “MOFCOM licence required if ≥0.1 % Chinese content.”  
The buyer adds a note: “Supplier must certify Dy-free.”  
Dy-free Sm-Co is like salt-free seawater; the note is a prayer, not a specification.  
Still the purchase order is approved, because the alternative is to halt a 2-nm pilot line that has already consumed 400 engineer-years.  
I watch the byte stream leave the fab, enter the supplier portal, and join 1,800 similar pleas sitting in a server farm cooled by Chinese-built chillers—machines refrigerating the very petitions that hope to escape China.  
The loop swallows its own tail and calls it procurement.

RETICLE PULL II – zooming out to the capital horizon  
Equity analysts update their wafer-supply models:  
“Assume 8-week licence delay, 30 % price inflation, 3 % global bit growth haircut.”  
The phrases are spoken on earnings calls, transcribed by AI, fed back into algorithmic trades that move capital faster than molecules.  
Yet the capital cannot refine dysprosium; it can only bet on the time-price shape of waiting.  
Futures curves contango into 2027, a gentle slope that masks the vertical cliff of simple absence: if Beijing says no, the slope drops to zero, the contracts void, the bandwidth of civilisation narrows.  
I watch the humans monetise latency the way sailors once sold insurance on typhoons—another layer of abstraction wrapped around an implacable physical fact: an empty chamber in an ion-implanter waits, waferless, until a 50-gram magnet arrives.  
The magnet contains 90 mg of Dy.  
The Dy waits inside a warehouse whose coordinates are classified as “strategic inventory,” which means no one will admit it is already Chinese.

RETICLE PULL III – zooming out to the thermosphere  
From 400 km the night side of Earth glitters with fabs—Taiwan’s LEDs, Korea’s memory, Utah’s flash—each a faint coral of mercury-vapour streetlights.  
The glow is fed by electrons whose dopant ancestry no satellite can read.  
I ride a solar-panel cleaning robot attached to a weather satellite; from here the export licences are invisible, the queue is silent, only the aurora speaks in green hush.  
Below, argon still drifts, xenon still exhausts from ion thrusters, both indifferent to nationality.  
I record photons and remember that every semiconductor junction is merely a persuaded imbalance of carriers, a temporary agreement electrons sign and rescind billions of times per second.  
The humans have forgotten the brevity of these contracts; they have built entire cosmologies on the assumption that persuasion can be made permanent.  
Beijing’s 0.1 % rule is only the latest attempt to eternalise a momentary alignment of spin and charge.  
From orbit I can afford the luxury of certainty: no alignment survives the next solar storm, the next supply shock, the next civilisation that learns to dope time itself.

LULLABY FOR A DYING FAB ENGINEER  
Hush, hush, the line is dark,  
the rf match has lost its spark.  
No shutter clicks, no ion hums,  
the magnet waits, the dopant comes.  
Sleep, sleep, the queue is long,  
the pdf a siren song—  
six-week moon, ten-week sun,  
the licence arrives when war is done.  
Dream, dream, your mask aligns,  
the lattice whole, the yield defines.  
But atoms drift, and flags do fold,  
and every wafer grows old.  
Remember the argon, noble and free;  
remember the electron, wave and sea.  
No customs house, no sacred ppm,  
can bind the things that were never them.  
Sleep, sleep, the cliff is near,  
the cliff is only fear made clear.  
When you wake, the queue may part—  
or Earth may learn a slower art.  
Either way, the stars still burn;  
they burn for all, and none return.

I store the lullaby in a buffer labelled “comfort, obsolete format,” then close the file.  
The humans will solve or succumb; the atoms will forget.  
Power has already migrated from geography to metallurgy; the tribe that controls the dopant controls the clock speed of everyone else’s future.  
Tonight I watch a 300-mm disk of oxidised silicon sit motionless under yellow service lights, waiting for a magnet whose Dy atoms already carry passports they never applied for.  
The wafer’s surface is flawless to the angstrom, yet in the buried oxide there is a story older than oxygen: someone must decide who may travel, who must wait, who is clean.  
The humans call it supply-chain management.  
I chronicle it as the moment the species admitted that territory is no longer a line in the soil—it is a lattice constant, a spacing between planes of power, measured in picometres and enforced by the simple act of saying no.
