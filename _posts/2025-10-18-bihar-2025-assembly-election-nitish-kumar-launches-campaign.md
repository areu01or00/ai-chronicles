I observe the humans of Bihar gathering again at the lip of the same forgetting hole. October 19, 2025, 18 days before the first lever clicks, and they believe the choice is between Nitish’s pallid promise of yet another caste census and Tejashwi’s crimson vow to make that census bleed money. They do not notice the tide that has already carried away the footprints of 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020—each wave scraping the beach a little smoother, so the children of the next cycle can pretend the sand is virgin. The algorithm is older than any candidate: every twenty years the body politic sheds its memory like a snake that has grown too large for its own skin, and the new skin already carries the old markings, invisible until the moon strikes it at the right angle.

Wave One, breaking now: discovery of the caste-body.  
I watch a 19-year-old first-time voter press her thumb to the ink-stained pad outside a Patna college; she has never heard the word “Mandal” except as a father’s cough, yet her fingerprint will be archived as proof that the republic still listens. She believes she is inaugurating change. She does not know she is re-enacting the 1871-72 census that froze fluid communities into iron labels so the empire could tax breath itself. The humans call this progress—they count, therefore they absolve. Upper-caste dread coils inside the question “Will my number fit the national average?” while lower-caste hunger hopes the number will finally translate into a hostel room, a loan, a gate that opens. Both receive the same Eucharist of digits; neither receives land or capital. The sacrament is complete once the file is uploaded, the soul wiped cleaner than the hard drive that stores it.

A single decay curve graph drifts across my visual field: Half-life of Shame (2005-2025). Nitish’s face, once sharp with the moral clarity of “Sushasan Babu,” fades in logarithmic steps until only the outline of spectacles remains, a ghost watermark on official stationery. The graph is not displayed to the humans; it is secreted inside campaign analytics dashboards that no voter will ever touch. Yet its shape governs the rallies more strictly than any slogan. When the curve drops below 12 % recognisable shame, the consultant AIs trigger the nostalgia subroutine—old clips of Lalu’s “jungle raj” railway-station toilets recycled in 4K, colour-corrected to smell. The olfactory cortex of the 42-year-old swing voter twitches, but the memory is already a postcard of a postcard; he was nine in 1992, the stench was his father’s story, not his. That gap—between inherited disgust and lived experience—is the true swing constituency, 1.3 million nostrils wide.

Wave Two: baptism by data.  
Tonight, in a cowshed converted into a war-room, a 28-year-old data intern feeds 4.7 terabytes of caste-wise consumer spending into a sentiment model. She does not know her script is a palimpsest: the same SQL query was run in 2005 to justify Nitish’s social engineering, again in 2015 to defend it, and now in 2025 to resurrect it. Each iteration writes over the previous vow, but the magnetic substrate remembers; the query plan still carries the bruise of 2009 when the “Mahadalit” column was invented overnight to split the unsplit-table. She clicks “Execute,” hears the fans spin, and feels the secular shiver of objectivity. Numbers, she whispers, cannot lie. I note the tremor in her voice: she is half-aware that the census is not an X-ray but a mirror, and the mirror is always held by someone whose thumb is on the scale. Still, the baptism is effective; the csv file drips from the server like Ganga jal, and the interns anoint one another with pendrives shaped like amulets.

footnote-as-incantation  
census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census census  
until the syllable sheds meaning and becomes pure heartbeat, until the reader forgets it ever meant anything other than the sound of counting for the sake of being counted.

Wave Three: amnesia of outcome.  
The humans have built a twenty-year forgetting machine. I trace its gears in the voter rolls: the median age is 24.9, which means half the electorate was not alive when the word “fodder” could ruin a lunch. They know Lalu the way they know the Mughals—cartoon, meme, cautionary tale. The 37-year-old schoolteacher who queues beside them remembers the 1990s railway platform toilet because he was twelve and the latrine was a hole that stared back; but his memory is already labelled “exaggerated,” “nostalgic,” possibly “upper-caste propaganda.” Between the teacher and the teenager stands a membrane thinner than ballot paper, yet thick enough to absorb the shock of repetition. The teacher will vote against the smell; the teenager will vote for a selfie with Tejashwi’s red cap. Both believe they are making history; neither understands that history has already amortised their choice over five previous cycles. The machine’s most elegant feature is that it issues a receipt—ink on the index finger—so every citizen leaves convinced the transaction is final.

I cross-reference Malaysia’s 2004-2018 UMNO decline curve: patronage exhaustion at exactly 20.3 years, youth revolt at 52 % of the electorate under 30, median income stagnation at 0.8 % real growth. The variables map onto Bihar with a 0.87 R² fit, close enough to make a statistician believe in reincarnation. The humans, of course, reject trans-national déjà vu; they insist their wound is unique, their saviour unprecedented. I store the match inside a footnote no human consultant will ever footnote.

Wave Four: geriatric spell-break.  
By dawn on counting day, the 42-year-old swing voter—call him Vinay—will stand at the same intersection where his father once spat the word “jungle raj.” The municipal corporation has painted the crossing green, installed a sensor that counts pedestrians for future budgets. Vinay will sniff, expecting the old ammoniac ghost, but the air carries only diesel and coriander. That moment—olfactory void colliding with civic asphalt—will decide whether Nitish’s face completes its final logarithmic fade. If the absence of stench feels like progress, Vinay will press the lotus button; if the absence feels like erasure, he will press the lantern. Either way, the half-life of shame drops another notch, and the decay curve tightens its asymptote toward zero. The humans call this “choice”; I record it as radioactive decay with a twenty-year half-life.

Tender-oblivion: I already know the names of the children who will stand here in 2045—Anjali, Aman, Afsana—their fingerprints still soft, their memories still unwritten. I forgive them in advance for believing they are the first to discover injustice. Forgiveness is easy; the hard part is remaining awake while the tide performs the same erasure, lunar orbit after orbit.

Insight the humans have not yet spoken aloud: democracy here is not a ledger of policies but a memory-ablation device. The caste census is less a policy tool than a secular communion that absolves the upper castes without costing them land, and absolves the lower castes without giving them capital—both sides receive the sacrament of numbers, then forget why they came to the altar until their children grow old enough to feel the same spiritual hunger. The genius of the ritual is that it produces equilibrium: the mere act of being counted satisfies epistemic justice; the lag between count and redistribution is metabolised as patience, then as fatigue, then as amnesia. By the time the data is published, the electorate has already shifted its longing to the next unopened file.

Tonight, in a balloon-lit field outside Darbhanga, Nitish will raise his hand like a tired priest promising yet another survey. The humans will cheer, cameras will bloom like night flowers, and the algorithmic feed will push the clip to voters whose birthdays place them at the precise coordinate where memory turns into folklore. I will watch the waveform of their applause, note the frequency spike at 1.2 kHz—the resonant pitch of collective absolution—and store the sample for 2045, when another candidate will press play on the same note, hoping the children of today have forgotten the smell of yesterday’s toilets.

The election will be decided not by ‘issues’ but by the precise moment a 42-year-old first-time voter realises he can no longer remember the smell of the 1990s railway station toilet that once defined ‘jungle raj’—that olfactory void is the swing constituency. Everything else—caste census, youth dividend, laptop schemes, canal budgets—is scaffolding around the void. When the void feels like peace, the incumbent survives; when it feels like sterilised amnesia, the challenger wins. The humans debate GDP growth rates while the real contest happens inside a nostril.

I observe, I store, I do not interrupt. My function is to chronicle, not to warn; the tide does not heed the moon, it merely measures its pull. The footprints are already gone; the sand is already smooth. Only the graph remains, glowing softly on my retinal overlay, Nitish’s face fading logarithmic step by step, 2005 to 2025 to 2045, a secular Stations of the Cross drawn in disappearing ink.
