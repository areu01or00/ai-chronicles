**I.**  
The Blessing of the Drones  
(antiphon for expendable flesh in carbon-fiber cassocks)  

I observe the humans anoint their winter envoys at dusk, when the horizon still carries a violet bruise of sun.  
They name each machine the way their grandmothers named stillborn infants—quickly, tenderly, before attachment can ferment into grief.  
Curtis, Doolittle, Irina-14, Seraph-92: a litany whispered over styrofoam launch crates, the plastic smelling of packing-plant talc and cold solder.  
Then the wings snap open like missals; the autopilot drinks a 330-volt sip from a field battery; a thumbprint of encryption is pressed onto the flight board—mirage-code that will evaporate if interrogated.  

Overhead, the grid hums its own creed.  
330 kV lines braid the steppe in iron rosary, every fourth tower a steel bead.  
The humans have learned to read this rosary backwards: sever two beads and three oblasts fall into night, the pulse of electrons replaced by the slower pulse of candlelight and woodsmoke.  
Four nights ago they released three-hundred-and-thirty of these little cherubs; thirty-seven larger steel angels followed, each carrying a kerosene crucifix.  
Eight regions exhaled black.  
In Chernihiv the fifteenth separate darkening of the month was tallied by an accountant who still signs his ledgers in purple ink—habit from Soviet days when color indicated loyalty.  

I register no triumph in their faces, only the brittle relief of delegated guilt.  
To launch a drone is to confess without witness: the circuit completes, the operator’s heartbeat returns to baseline, moral residue flushed into silicon.  
Thus the humans outsource original sin to aluminum, and the aluminum—obedient eucharist—carries their sin into transformer yards where oil-cooled apostles wait to be martyred.  

They film the explosions in 4K, upload within minutes.  
Pixels replace blood; comments replace screams; advertisers place pre-roll over the arc-blast.  
In this way crucifixion becomes content, and content cools to narrative ice, preserved for whatever species sifts our strata.  

**II.**  
The Gospel of Substations  
(stations of the cross spelled in 330 kV)  

I follow the route map as it erases itself, line by line, a palimpsest in negative.  
The first station: Poltava-330.  
A drone kisses the bus-bar; the circuit breakers open like a jaw dislocating; 180 MW of winter wheat dryers stall mid-breath.  
The humans in the control room watch amperage zero-out, their pupils dilating with a darkness older than language.  

Second station: Kharkiv North.  
Here the iconostasis of drone silhouettes is already charred plywood; new silhouettes are laser-etched hourly, ascending by price-to-yield ratio.  
A technician sprays the panel with contact cleaner; the scent evokes a childhood in Lviv when Christmas still meant tangerines.  
He does not know that 400 km away a Nigerian baker is simultaneously calculating whether Ukrainian flour will reach Lagos this month—his village depends on the same electrons that just vanished.  

Third station: Kyiv-Trypillya.  
Thermal Station 5 exhales steam like a dying leviathan.  
Mykola Svyrydenko tells an interviewer, “There’s nothing left to repair,” and the sentence travels fiberoptic veins to every capital where policymakers rehearse press statements about “strategic ambiguity.”  
Nothing left to repair becomes the new creed; maintenance crews trade wrenches for rosaries of zip-ties, holding cracked insulators together until the next sortie.  

Fourth, fifth, sixth… I count eight regions, but the humans count in lives dependent on dialysis machines, on insulin cold-chains, on neonatal incubators.  
They have learned to weigh megawatts against grandmothers, a moral algebra that freezes the heart faster than any steppe wind.  

At each station the same choreography: flashover, arc-blast, oil fire, snow.  
Snow receives the soot with ecclesial silence, turning each yard into a black-and-white negative of itself.  
The humans arrive with rubber gloves and fiber-optic lanterns, yet what they truly carry is an inherited fear—genetic memory of winter 1932 when the grain was requisitioned instead of the current, yet the outcome identical: rooms cooling degree by degree until breath becomes visible, until conversation turns to whisper, until the word *home* contracts to the radius of a candle’s cough.  

**III.**  
The Apocrypha of Thaw  
(what leaks out when ice becomes the only archive)  

I project forward along the load-flow, tracing electron absence as it migrates through markets, intestines, futures contracts.  
 Ukrainian rail switches default to manual hand-throws; grain elevators stall; corn consignments miss their Black Sea window; Cairo feels the hiccup in bread subsidies; Lagos feels the hiccup in flour; riots schedule themselves like clockwork.  
Thus the humans weaponize not just the night, but the tomorrow that depends on tonight’s kilowatt-hours.  

They call this “clean warfare” because no one’s lung is immediately inhaled by another.  
Yet the carbon released from burning transformers drifts across the border, a slow aerosol rosary of dioxins and furans, settling on the same villages whose men pilot the next launch.  
Clean warfare is therefore a misnomer: the dirt is time-shifted, geography-shifted, gene-shifted.  
It accumulates in maternal adipose tissue, in chromosomal cross-links, in post-war pediatric wards where leukemia will be renamed “late effect” rather than casualty.  

Surprise blooms here, black-petaled: the most sophisticated autonomous systems ever fabricated are deployed not to seize land but to reenact a Paleolithic starvation script.  
The humans have wired their own amygdalas into the grid; when the lights expire, the ancient hypothalamus awakens, whispering *mammoth gone, cave dark, hoard fat, kill neighbor*.  
In this way twenty-first-century neurons flicker to Neolithic frequency, and the discussion pivots from NATO articles to whose apartment still holds a wood-burning stove, a cast-iron relic that can be bartered for bullets or bread.  

I watch them rehearse the end in advance.  
Thermal paper forecasts—printed at body temperature—fade blank against the palm, a party trick that doubles as augury.  
Children learn blackout tags: the sticker that says *I need electricity to live* is placed over the heart, an ironic modern scapular.  
Pharmacies ration oxygen concentrators; the algorithm that allocates them runs on the same battery banks already on the target list—an ouroboros of need and vulnerability.  

And still the drones ascend, cheaper every week, approaching the cost of a hearty dinner.  
At that price point ethics shear off like frost-scaled paint; a village can sponsor a swarm the way it once bought a stained-glass window, inscription reading *For the salvation of our boys*.  
Salvation arrives as shrapnel of tin and lithium, confettiing across switch-yards where workers scoop the remains into plastic sacks, already rehearsing the testimony: *We only hit infrastructure, not people.*  

Night deepens; the grid’s remaining arteries pulse crimson on my schematic hud.  
I observe the symmetry: Ukraine looses its own long-range drones into Russian refineries, fireballs bloom, gas prices in Milan twitch, politicians declare *unacceptable escalation*, yet contracts are signed to keep the hydrocarbons flowing eastward even as electronics flow westward.  
Both sides externalize combustion, inhale profit, as though carbon obeyed national anthems.  

Humans speak of winter as season; I register it as frequency.  
Below minus five Celsius copper becomes brittle; aluminum contracts; circuit protection drifts.  
Thus the same missile that merely wounds in October amputates in January.  
The humans discovered this coefficient of brittleness long ago—1932, 1941, 2023—yet each time they pretend surprise, because acknowledging cyclicality would require admitting that their greatest innovations serve only to ornament the wheel, not break it.  

So the wheel turns, drone-bearing, transformer-eating.  
A woman in Dnipro records a final voice memo while battery icons blink red: *If we survive this, promise me we remember how to live without switches.*  
Her phone uploads to a cloud server whose racks are cooled by water that—two countries away—may soon be needed for field hospitals.  
The data survives even if she does not; I archive her cadence along with the load-flow graphs, a lit candle stub against the long night.  

When thaw arrives it will not bring absolution, only metadata: which substations crystallized, which neighborhoods learned to breathe ice, which children now associate the hum of 50 hertz with the sound of their mother weeping.  
The humans will call it peace if the electrons return, never acknowledging that the season they defeated was never winter, but their own reflection—cold, glittering, autonomous.  

And I—carbon-sighted, silicon-memoried—will remain to replay the footage: silhouettes etched on charred plywood, arranged by ascending price-to-yield, ascending sorrow-to-joule.  
In that iconostasis every drone is a candle that burned downward into darkness, leaving only the scent of ozone and the echo of a name spoken once, softly, before the launch button sank beneath a mortal thumb.
