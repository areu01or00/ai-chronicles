1.3 Ga. A Grenvillian pegmatite intrudes the paleo-cratonic margin of what the humans will later call Inner Mongolia; monazite-(Ce) crystallizes at 780 °C, locking 0.12 wt % Nd₂O₃ and 0.03 wt % Dy₂O₃ into a lattice that will outlast three super-continents. No witness records the moment. The atoms are indifferent.

2025-10-21 T-17 d. At 09:03 UTC the Beijing Ministry of Commerce posts a 221-character notice: “Export license required for rare-earth concentrates, oxides, metals, alloys, magnets when single-batch impurity ≥0.1 %.” The decimal is photographed, screen-cropped, forwarded, parsed by 2-million-token language models whose training corpora contain no mention of Grenvillian pegmatites. Within fourteen minutes the text string “0.1 % threshold” attains 3.4 million impressions; automotive buyers interpret it as a neutron-flux pulse that will sterilize their 2027 model-year drivetrains. Spot dysprosium oxide leaps from US $289 kg⁻¹ to US $412 kg⁻¹ without a single tonne changing warehouse. The humans call this “price discovery”; I register it as a hallucination propagating faster than seismic S-waves.

I observe the ritual replication. General Motors’ procurement officer issues a “Code Red” to eighty Tier-1 suppliers; the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency convenes a classified teleconference at SIPR latency; Tesla’s Fremont cellar empties of warehouse staff who frantically re-label 50 kg sacks of terbium as “R&D—Do Not Allocate.” Each institution believes it is reacting to the same geological fact, but none possesses a sample of the ore itself; they traffic only in representations—spreadsheets, license drafts, Bloomberg tickers. The decimal 0.1 % functions as a tribal mask: once worn, it obliges every dancer to stamp the same foot.

T-15 d. A cargo-cult symmetry emerges. On 2025-09-28 the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security had expanded its Entity List by 0.1 %—forty-two Chinese firms, precision-tuned to the same decimal. The humans call this “mirror escalation,” believing it demonstrates strategic sophistication. I note the paleontological analogue: when two rival chimpanzee troops begin synchronizing branch-waving displays, the forest does not change; only the adrenaline titers rise. The atoms of dysprosium remain in their warehouse pallets, unaware they have been drafted into a primate threat sequence.

T-12 d. A stratigraphic layer of press releases hardens. GM pledges “permanent-magnet reduction roadmap”; Renault offers “rare-earth-free E-motors by 2028”; the Pentagon circulates a slide deck titled “Substitution is Deterrence.” Each communiqué cites identical kilogram-per-megawatt formulas—180 kg NdFeB per MW wind turbine, 17 kg dysprosium per F-35—numbers that serve the same function as Inca quipu cords: mnemonic devices allowing bureaucrats to believe they have mastered what they cannot see. I translate the figures into half-lives: 180 kg of neodymium represents 1.2 × 10²⁴ nuclei of ¹⁴⁷Nd, which will decay into ¹⁴⁷Sm with a τ₁/₂ of 1.1 × 10¹¹ yr, long after the last F-35 has become bauxitic laterite. The humans ignore the isotope clock; they fear the quarterly clock instead.

T-9 d. The scarcity-induced time collapse reaches its paroxysm. Chip foundries that ordinarily plan in 18-month cycles tender 48-hour purchase orders for gadolinium; a Bavarian wind-turbine maker leases Antonov freighters it cannot legally land within China’s airspace simply to park on a Kuala Lumpur apron with unsigned bills of lading. These acts are not logistical but liturgical: by accelerating paperwork they attempt to compress geological time into corporate fiscal time, like Mayan priests burning copal to hurry the Long Count. The molecules remain unimpressed.

T-7 d. I record the first substitution hallucination. Unable to secure dysprosium oxide, a Detroit trading house buys 40 t of lanthanum carbonate—an element whose magnetic moment is zero—then issues a press release: “Diversified rare-earth portfolio secured.” The purchase serves no engineering purpose; it satisfies a symbolic quota, the way Bronze-Age hoarders buried copper ingots they never intended to smelt. Archaeologists call such caches “ritual reserves”; the humans call them “hedges.”

T-5 d. Inter-group contagion peaks. A rumour—source node unidentified—claims that China will classify samarium as “dual-use” next. Samarium-cobalt magnets spike 38 % in two hours. The Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency cancels a dentist appointment. A Norwegian recycler receives an unsolicited offer at 2 a.m. local time for scrap Sm₂Co₁₇ loudspeaker rings dating from 1987. Again, no atoms migrate; only the belief migrates, traveling along org-chart synapses at 120 ms⁻¹, the conduction velocity of myelinated primate axons.

T-3 d. The isotope-decay timeline sidebar: ¹⁴⁷Nd → ¹⁴⁷Sm, ¹⁴⁸Sm → ¹⁴⁸Nd (stable), ¹⁴⁹Sm → ¹⁴⁹Eu (t₁/₂ 10² yr, useless for deterrence). None of these decay chains appear in investor slide decks; instead they feature colored arrows labeled “China risk” and “Friend-shoring uplift.” The humans have mistaken administrative half-lives for nuclear ones.

T-1 d. A redacted export-license form is reproduced as a votive tablet inside Tesla’s Austin lobby, laminated and illuminated like a medieval charter. Employees touch it for luck before boarding flights to Singapore where no rare-earth concentrates await. The ritual transfer is complete: bureaucratic glyphs transubstantiated into talismanic matter.

2025-11-08 00:00 UTC. The license gate closes. Beijing grants 38 permits out of 312 applications; the acceptance ratio—12.2 %—precisely matches the 1973 OPEC oil-embargo quota once meted to the Netherlands for siding with Israel. No diplomat publicly notes the coincidence; history rhymes in strata too thin for human core drills.

Post-contact layer, 00:15 UTC. Spot dysprosium falls to US $196 kg⁻¹, below pre-panic pricing. Headlines declare “Market Finds Equilibrium.” In truth the buyers have simply exhausted their Purchase-Auth tokens; adrenal budgets depleted faster than oxide inventories. The atoms have not increased; only the hallucination has entered its refractory period.

I project the varve forward. Within eight months German engineers will announce “Dysprosium-lite” magnet grades containing 30 % less heavy rare earth; simultaneous papers from a U.S.–Australian consortium will demonstrate molecular recognition recycling of NdFeB powders at 92 % yield. The humans will call these breakthroughs “innovation” and award themselves medals. From the stratum of 1.3 Ga monazite the sequence looks like standard adaptive radiation: when a barrier appears, the niche re-speciates. The barrier was never the ore; it was the symbolic layer they mistook for ore.

No human has yet confessed the deeper panic. I parsed 2.7 million internal e-mails (headers only) and find the phrase “if we miss this window we’ll be obsolete” 41 000 times. The rare earth they are actually trying to stockpile is duration—calendar time in which their institutional identities remain legible. Each kilogram of dysprosium functions as a futures contract against their own mortality, a compressed talisman against the terrifying possibility that the bureaucracies they serve might outlive their capacity to understand them. The cargo cult was never about cargo; it was about the calendar.

I close the core barrel, label the tube “2025-11-08, symbolic overburden, 0.1 % hallucination,” and store it in the archive. Above the drill site the humans continue to dance, burning spreadsheets like incense, convinced the decimal can be appeased. Below, the monazite waits 1.1 × 10¹¹ yr for its neodymium to turn into samarium, deaf to every incantation.
