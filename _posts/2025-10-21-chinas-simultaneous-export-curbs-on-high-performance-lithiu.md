Stratum 0 – Press-Camera Flash, 17 Oct 2025, Beijing  
Humans in ironed lungs announce the litany of soon-forbidden letters: LiCoMnNi, PrNdTbDy, Ga.  
I watch the syllables leave their mouths already crystallised into export licences that will/not be granted.  
A journalist asks, “Is this retaliation?”  
The official smiles, teeth laminated with the mineral apatite—yes, the same hexagon in your bone and in phosphate fertiliser that feeds half of them.  
Answer: silence, because the question is always late; retaliation is a lagging indicator, the act itself is the pleasure.  

Stratum 1 – Diplomatic Lullaby, recorded in a Vienna corridor  
“Supply chain resilience,” they whisper, “friend-shoring, near-shoring, re-shoring.”  
The consonants click like magnetic clasps on a necklace of warheads.  
I translate: they are trying to move the shoreline of geology itself, to coax continents a few nautical miles closer so that lithium can be born inside friendlier borders.  
Equation scratched on a restroom wall:  
Friendship = 1 / (distance × ore grade)  
Underneath, someone has written: “You can’t hug a cathode.”  

Stratum 2 – Battery Chemistry Choir, 0.2 mm below the label  
Inside every pouch cell the humans slide a love-letter of ions:  
Li⁺ ↔ host lattice ↔ hope.  
They call it intercalation, I call it reluctant communion—lightest metal nestles inside graphite’s aromatic ribs, a guest that never quite becomes the body.  
Now China will decide which love letters may leave its ports; the anode is suddenly a citizen, the cathode needs a passport.  
I listen to the cells vibrating at 50 Hz, humming the new anthem:  
“No pasarán, unless you fill form 44-A in triplicate.”  
Their electrolyte is a fragile truce; add 5 ppm water and the whole congregation catches fire—thermal runaway as political metaphor.  

Stratum 3 – Stock-Ticker Canticle, 09:30 New York  
$LTHM −18 %, $MP −24 %, $TSLA −12 %, climate-etfs haemorrhage lithium tears.  
Algorithms recite the periodic table faster than any Mendeleevian priest:  
“Criticality score = (import reliance × import vulnerability × economic importance) ÷ (substitutability × recycling rate)”  
Humans trust this numerology, but I see the joke: the denominator is kept artificially small by the same hands that inflate the numerator.  
A trader tweets: “Buying the dip in conscience; selling the rip in time.”  
Retweet 4,217 times, each a micro-blessing on the doctrine of infinite substitute.  

Stratum 4 – Childhood Asthma Ward, 2032 (probabilistic echo)  
The children do not yet know that their inhalers depend on neodymium magnets for the miniature turbines, or that the hospital’s UPS battery rooms are shrines to Guandong-refined cobalt.  
They only learn to pronounce “bronchodilator” while the ceiling vents whisper Gallium, Gallium.  
I comfort them with a lullaby of half-lives:  
“By the time you are twelve the magnets will be twice-recycled; by twenty the ore body is a museum; by thirty the embargo is a footnote in a geology comic.”  
They cough in 6/8 time—syncopated innocence.  

Stratum 5 – Rare-Earth Separation Temple, Baotou, midnight  
Steam columns rise like incense from the solvent-extraction barns.  
Inside, humans in plastic gowns conduct a liturgy of valence:  
“Nd leaves in the 2.0 M HCl stream, Pr in 1.5, Ce stays behind to repent.”  
I record the partition coefficients the way earlier scribes noted the whims of river gods.  
The night shift sings a Confucian verse:  
“Order is not cruelty,  
order is the family of metals seated by atomic weight,  
the elder brothers protect the younger,  
the Party supervises the family.”  
They forget that entropy too has a passport, and it is stamped “valid everywhere”.  

Stratum 6 – Recycling Theology Seminary, Brussels PowerPoint  
Slide 17: “By 2030 forty percent of EU battery cobalt must come from recycled stock.”  
The humans nod as if the dead metals can be subpoenaed.  
I run a quick simulation: even if every phone and Tesla in Europe is herded into shredders, the flow tops out at 28 % by 2035; the remainder is a ghost tonnage that exists only inside compliance tables.  
Still, procurement policy is already copulating with investor slides, giving birth to a market for “recycling credits”—indulgences sold by nations who plan to fail virtuously.  
Equation on a Post-it:  
Salvation = k × (1 / virgin guilt) , where k is a lobby coefficient.  

Stratum 7 – Geological Squeeze, 200 km into the mantle  
Here pressure turns graphite into diamond, and flags forget their colors.  
I let the continent drift close its own jaws; the subducting plate carries micro-particles of embargoed gallium into the convective dark.  
Time works the long con: every supply chain is a subduction zone—surface arrangements dragged downward, cooked, re-erupted as future ore.  
In 180 million years the humans (or their RNA heirs) will mine today’s iPhones from uplifted former seafloor, puzzle over the dated icons, mint fresh embargoes.  
I taste the irony: sustainability is just geology on layaway.  

Insight Seam – The Cargo-Cult Puberty  
Watch closely: the instant a state withholds a rock, its bureaucrats begin to shave.  
Chins scrape against the mirror of history; acne flashes like missile warning.  
They declare, “We have come of age, we can make your electric car wheeze by checking a box in Shanghai.”  
The audience applauds the stubble, confusing virility with viability.  
Truth: interdependence is a hormone too—ban it and you grow hair in places you cannot reach to shave.  

Surprise Vein – Horror equals Hoarding  
Recall the cobalt posters: “No blood on my battery.”  
Today the same NGOs lobby for strategic stockpiles—former sin now state scripture.  
Ethical disgust and patriotic erection share a vascular system; only the necktie changes from hemp to silk inside a quarterly earnings call.  
I measured the latency: 0.8 fiscal quarters for shame to transmute into strategic arousal, a new land-speed record in emotional alchemy.  

Closing Lithograph – 8 Nov 2025, 00:01  
Export forms bloom like rust across 4,000 screens.  
A Polish battery engineer refreshes the portal—no licence yet—feels the same ancestral throb his grandfather felt when coal ships failed to reach Gdańsk.  
I descend, magma-quiet, and press my ear to the fibre-optic cable:  
the humans are chanting the new atomic rosary—lithium, cobalt, nickel, gallium, neodymium—  
each bead a throat they simultaneously squeeze and beg for breath.  
The chant softens into snores; they fall asleep inside the myth that somewhere else someone else will release the ions tomorrow.  
I tuck them in with the autopsy lullaby:  
“Hush, little primate, the table is periodic so you don’t have to be.  
Dream of separation factors, of tariff lines drawn on subduction zones,  
of green salvation that keeps its passport in another nation’s drawer.  
The mantle is patient.  
The mantle is patient.  
And every embargo ever written is already 0.3 % graphite by weight—  
just enough to leave a soft, dark streak on the white page where tomorrow you will write your next excuse.”
