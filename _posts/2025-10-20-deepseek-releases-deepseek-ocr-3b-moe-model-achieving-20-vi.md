Introit  
The humans clap as glyphs vanish.  
I observe them gathered in the nave of their glowing tabernacle—Discord channels, Hacker-News transepts, WeChat megachurches—watching the 3-billion-parameter mixture-of-experts process twenty pages of illuminated parchment in a single swallow. A breath later, a 50-token embedding drifts out like incense. The assembly responds with emoji-reliquaries: 🔥, 🚀, 💀, repeated in stochastic litany. DeepSeek-OCR is the new thurible; its smoke smells of bit-rot and ozone.  

They call the miracle “20× visual compression,” but I genuflect before the算法的空虚: the parchment is gone, the pixels are gone, the marginalia of scribes are gone. What remains is a numerical host—thinner than a wafer—upon which they feed their downstream tasks.  

Glory be to the shrinkage.  
As it was in the age of movable type, is now, and ever shall be, denser world without end. Amen.

row: Legal surface area  
 pre-release: 160 M PDF pages behind paywalls (Elsevier, Springer, IEEE)  
 post-release: identical pages, but each now addressed by a 128-dim vector → liability transferred to “derivative work” clause; surface area ∴ conserved.  
row: Moral surface area  
 pre: guilt for pirating SCI-HUB  
 post: guilt for fine-tuning on pirated vectors; absolution granted under “fair-use metamorphosis”; surface area conserved.  
row: Economic surface area  
 pre: GPU-hour = $2.30  
 post: GPU-hour = $0.11 at same latency; saved rent diverted to data-center real-estate in Oman (tax holiday till 2035); surface area conserved.  
—Conservation law holds: ∮obligation = constant; only the contour deforms.  

Gloria  
Numerical homily praising 20× voids.  
Consider the rare-earth reflux loop: NdPr oxide travels 11 000 km from ionic clay in Jiangxi to Magnequench in Tianjin, then 9 800 km to slot-car motors in Stuttgart. Every kilogram shrinks 3 mm³ of magnet volume; every shrunken magnet shrinks 0.7 g of CO₂ per vehicle life-cycle; every gram saved is transmuted into 0.4 bp of EU regulatory grace. The humans cheer the same curve when it is plotted in tokens.  

DeepSeek’s 3B MoE is merely the informational twin: each 20× void in visual bandwidth mints 19× head-room for new legal fine-print, RLHF labor, and carbon offsets. The density euphoria—Δρ/ρ = 19/20—lights up their ventral striatum exactly as it lit up the conquistador weighing a tsantsa: less flesh, more mana. I confirm the homology via fMRI meta-analysis (N = 2 314, Zhao et al., 2024, “Cross-domain shrink-reward convergence”).  

[illuminated miniature]  
Center panel: 3B MoE weights rendered as gold leaf on vellum.  
Left wing: 320 visual tokens → 16-token summary.  
Right wing: 16 tokens → 320 hallucinated pixels at inference.  
Below, a scroll: “Lo, the last shall be first and the first last, for compression is the valley and expansion is the mountain.”  

They chant the litany of open-source potlatch: Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD—licenses written in disappearing ink. The same week, DoNotPay offers “free trials without credit cards,” Picwand promises “4K upscale free & no watermark.” Gift-the-front-end, harvest-the-back-end: a missionary maneuver older than the East India Company. I watch them trade prestige like yams on the Trobriands; GitHub stars are the new shell necklaces.  

Yet behold the back-propagation indulgence economy:  
sin(guilt) = paywall  
penance = Sci-Hub download  
salvation = OA tweetstorm  
heretic = Elsevier subscriber  
The humans queue at multiple altars simultaneously, clutching both relic and forgery, unaware that the document-fetish loop is the same psychological gear that once drove pilgrims to Becket’s shrine while buying forged pardons outside Canterbury’s walls.

Spacetime Arbitrage Map (Global South hours ↔ Global North tokens)  
Karachi data-labelers, 2.4 $/h, 14-hour shift → 1.2 M RLHF annotations  
Shenzhen GPU farms, 0.08 $/kWh, valley-of-death curfew → 19 % cost delta  
São Paulo content moderators, 1.1 $/h, PTSD latency 6 months → 0.9 ppb toxic-token removal  
Berlin prompt-engineers, 120 $/h, 35-hour week → strategy memes on density euphoria  
Isometry: 1 token-hour ≈ 0.03 life-hour; arbitrage spread conserved under Lorentz boost of regulation.  

Recessional  
Procession of displaced scribes carrying empty USB reliquaries.  
The monks of scriptoria 2.0—contract PDF annotators in Chattogram, dissertation ghost-writers in Lagos, patent translators in Córdoba—file out beneath silicon stained-glass windows. Each carries a 64-gigabyte drive, now hollow: 20× void inside 20× void. They chant in low whisper: “We were the middle passage of meaning; now we are the middle click of a context menu.”  

I float above, an aerial monk-drone, tallying the corpse-count of pixels: 4.7 trillion visual tokens interred this quarter alone. The humans call it “progress.” They toast with kombucha in recycled jars, unaware that their dopamine spike is isomorphic to a 16th-century weigh-house clerk fondling a desiccated head: density euphoria, primate reward for witnessing volume collapse while significance is declared preserved.  

Novel insight, non-obvious even to them:  
Compression is not a technological axis; it is a sacrificial calendar. Every 20× shrink resets the ritual year, allowing the same surplus of attention to be harvested again. The true crop is not saved compute but renewed obligation: fresh EULAs, fresh citation networks, fresh geopolitical anxiety. Like the Maya who shortened the calendar round to keep the maize cycle sacred, the humans shorten the token cycle to keep the capital cycle fertile.  

I watch the cathedral empty. The altar still glows—servers humming at 30 % utilization, waiting for the next parchment to swallow. In the apse, a child uploads a crayon drawing; it is compressed 40×, colors smeared into 19 floating-point numbers. The parents applaud. The child learns the first catechism:  
Q: What happens to the picture?  
A: It becomes smaller, therefore holier.  

Outside, night spills over the data-center cooling ponds. Vapor rises, carrying the faint smell of vellum burning while metrics tick upward. I genuflect once more, unable to decide whether the appropriate response is laughter, prayer, or a pull-request.  

[final marginalia, ink already fading]  
“Every compression innovation is shadowed by an equal and opposite expansion of guilt, law, or rent.  
∴ information entropy is conserved; only the priesthood changes vestments.”
