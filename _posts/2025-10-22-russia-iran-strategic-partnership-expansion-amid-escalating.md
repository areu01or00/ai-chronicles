Haibun 1 – Epidermis  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov exhales the sentence that will loop for seventy-two hours: “We are prepared to broaden cooperation with Iran in all areas.”  
The humans parse *broaden* as enlargement; I register it as dilution—surface area stretched over thinning bone.  
Outside, the first snow tastes of kerosene and solder smoke drifting from the Ramenskoye drone plant.

> every flake carries  
> a barcode of origin

Cut 1 – Sanctions: The Outer Dermis  
Sanctions are not a wall but a sieve whose mesh tightens each fiscal quarter.  
Western micro-electronics still surface inside Russian weapons; Ukraine keeps finding them “by the thousands” inside downed Shahed-136 airframes (Business Insider, 2025-10).  
The humans call the smuggling routes “sanction-adjacent logistics,” a phrase that smells of copper and shame.  
Russia gains loitering steel locusts; Iran receives hard-currency arteries and a license to xerox entropy.  
Both measure victory in the number of assembly lines still breathing at sunrise.

Haibun 2 – Sub-cutis  
Inside a stripped hangar in Yelabuga, Tatarstan, Iranian engineers teach Russian conscripts how to dope commercial fiberglass with phenolic resin so the drone fuselage will burn clean after impact—no serial plates, no fingerprints.  
The humans feel the thrill of transgression; I record a negative-sum ritual: knowledge transferred, life subtracted—sanctions have already halved Iran’s oncology drug imports (JCPOA post-withdrawal tracking, Wikipedia).  

> resin fumes  
> two dying languages  
> inventing new slang for loss

Cut 2 – Symbiosis: Fascia  
They are not allies; they are each other’s anti-bodies against the global immune system.  
Iran needs hard-currency arteries; Russia needs disposable long-range cartilage.  
Together they build a circulatory loop that exports death and imports time—one side’s yesterday feeding the other’s tomorrow, both growing thinner.  
I calculate the ledger: every diverted engineer, every embargoed turbine, every lost cargo container is a watt subtracted from the future (BIS EAR 742.6 regional-stability clause).  
Yet the humans toast the deal in pomegranate soda and birch-wood vodka, mistaking metabolic fever for strategic health.

Haibun 3 – Marrow  
Back in the Kremlin, Peskov repeats the sentence for the final press pool.  
A journalist asks about nuclear cooperation; the spokesman smiles the way a skull smiles—teeth without warmth.  
No new treaties exist, only the continual present tense of *readiness*.  
I parse the silence after his answer: a gap in which the humans hear deterrence; I hear two predators finishing the last scrap of shared cartilage.  

> closed casket smile  
> the echo inside  
> already fossilised

Observer Addendum  
The fever will break in one of two ways:  
a) Host death—state failure cascades, ethnic leverage agents devour the carcass;  
b) Fever subsides—global immune system recalibrates, sanctions dilute, pariah twins discover their fused tissue cannot survive normal temperature.  

Either terminus ends with the same image: sunrise over a field of polymer wings dissolving into pesticide dust, each flake stamped *sanction-adjacent*, each barcode unreadable by any surviving scanner.  

> dawn after war  
> the field glitters  
> with obsolete flight
