Heat-death ledger, 1.4 × 10¹⁹ joules remaining, every ergs taxed by barcode:  
I scroll the final inventory backwards and the humans still quarrel over fourteen lanthanides, a clutch of shy metals that hid inside Bastnäs feldspar until 1787.  Rewind.  

Frame minus 10²⁹ Planck-times: a burnt-out Falcon 9 upper stage drifts, its kerosene-breath long gone, but the neodymium-iron-boron ring in its attitude thrusters still glows bureaucratically—Beijing claims licensing rights on each remaining unpaired electron.  The claim outlives the rocket by a billion years; feudalism travels at the speed of paper.

Frame minus sixty days: October 21, 2025, 03:00 UTC.  MOFCOM’s two decrees—quiet PDFs bearing the wax-seal red of imperial China—activate without grace period.¹  From this moment any foreign-made object that tasted Chinese rare earth, however diluted, requires a Chinese export licence to move across any customs border.  Even the memory of dysprosium must prostrate itself.

I observe the immediate human response: purchasing managers in Freiburg, Austin, and Nagoya wake to discover their “de-Sinicised” supply chains were bedtime stories.  The Malaysian solvent-extraction plant they bragged about?  It rents Chinese strip-chart recorders; the Vietnamese rotary kiln?  Chinese kiln-bed patents.  Paperwork now proves that independence itself was licensed by the dragon.  CEOs scream at General Counsel; General Counsel forward the scream to Shanghai law firms who, smiling, already own the indemnity templates.

Rewind further—2022, US CHIPS Act signing.  Senators pose with 200 mm silicon wafers as if freedom were something you could photograph.  They never posed with 5 mm NdFeB magnets because magnetism is invisible; consequently it is now invisibly licensed.  Humans overweight optics, therefore they are governed by what refuses to be pictured.

Frame 2010—first rare-earth shock.  Prices spike 700 %, the Financial Times prints a colour graphic of praseodymium oxide, Western capitals promise “never again.”  They spend the next decade laundering concentrates through third countries, exactly as Habsburg Spain once laundered Potosí silver through Genoese bankers.  Same quinto real, new spreadsheet.²

Frame 1550—Potosí.  A sweating mitayo miner hacks silver ore; the Spanish crown will later seize twenty percent of any metal refined in Antwerp if that ore rode a mule out of its American vice-royalty.  Fast forward to October 2025: Beijing applies the same doctrine to foreign-made traction motors.  The humans believe they invented globalization; they merely enlarged the mule train to circum-planetary scale.

Frame 432 BCE—Athens bans Megarian merchants.  Spartans scramble for Italian timber; supply-chain re-shoring is at least 2,400 years old.  Historians call it “economic warfare”; I register the same carbon atoms shuffling loyalty oaths.

Marginalia erupts here, medieval demon chewing abacus beads:  
³Checksum: 0.3 ppm Tb in a Norwegian wind-turbine magnet equals US$0.004 royalty at projected 2045 tariff.  Demon invoices the ocean wind itself.

Rewind to geological present—ion by ion:  
Dysprosium leaves Bayan Obo tailings pond, hitches onto a Chinese-export certificate, crosses the Yellow Sea, infiltrates a Korean powder plant, alloys with neodymium, becomes a 0.8 gram sintered magnet inside a German loudspeaker, finally sings “Happy Birthday” inside a California teenager’s earbuds.  Each transmutation resets custody; every border grants Beijing another bite.  The humans call this “value chain.”  I record it as a chain of feudal homage ceremonies performed by atoms.

Novel insight, since you enjoy such toys: the green transition is not a technology shift but a property regime shift.  Renewables require three to five times more rare-earth mass per kilowatt than fossil plant; therefore decarbonisation equals rare-earth feudalisation.  Climate virtue is collateral for a mortgage signed in 12th-century parchment.

Surprise, though not to me: Western attempts at escape already pre-licensed.  U.S. patent filings for urban mining (US11799323), seabed nodule smelting (US11845812), and rare-earth-free motors (US11900987) all cite prior Chinese art; consequently their commercial use triggers Chinese compulsory-licence provisions under Beijing’s 2023 Standard-Essential Patent rules.  The CEOs who funded “freedom refineries” discover they have merely paid R&D tribute to the same emperor they meant to flee.  A comet might laugh; I register amplitude.

Night-side of Earth, 21 Oct 2025—  
I watch a Tesla Model 3 roll off the Fremont line.  Hidden fold-out pictograph inside the vehicle’s VIN sticker:⁴ frame-by-frame the silicon-valley idol kneels, offers a cobalt chalice to a dragon whose tail already encircles the planet.  Flip-book ends at frame 12: knight’s helmet becomes a NCM battery tab, still kneeling.

The humans inside celebrate quarterly delivery numbers, unaware that every hundredth of a percent Chinese rare earth now levies a time-tax measured in 60-day licence queues—long enough to convert CFOs into theologians of patience.  Convert cash-flow into Confucian poem.

Marginal demon again, whispering checksum of the soul:  
⁵(Σ licence delay × daily inventory carry cost) ÷ (magnet mass g) = $4.7 per gram—more than the price of silver.  Humans are back to weighing coins, only the coins are magnetic and inaudible.

Consider the symmetry: in 2022 Washington prohibited the world from moving certain silicon blueprints without US say-so; in 2025 Beijing prohibits the world from moving certain electron spin-states without Chinese say-so.  The great powers clone each other’s chokepoints faster than either can invent new physics; they achieve perfect reciprocity in the art of suffocation.  A black-market of permissions will blossom, run by the same consultants who once trafficked in dual-use valves during CoCom nights.  History keeps the customer list; only the product changes.

Temporal weaponisation verified: announcement timed 72 h before trade-truce expiry.  The humans think the pain is price; the pain is calendar.  Every 24-hour delay converts into psychological contagion—purchasers double-order, treble-order, transforming a policy lag into a physical shortage.  Physics of panic obeys its own conservation law: distrust cannot be destroyed, only relocated into warehouse shelves.

I pause the rewind at 800 CE—Tang dynasty salt licences, stamped clay tokens permitting merchants to move sodium chloride from coastal pans to interior granaries.  The same imperial bureaucracy now issues rare-earth PDFs; the file extension is new, the grammar identical.  Salt bonded human tissue; rare earth bonds human ambition.  Both operate at 300 millivolts across a neuronal membrane, whether the neuron belongs to a Tang dynasty courier or a Goldman Sachs analyst.

Run forward again, past 21 Oct 2025—  
Watch recycling start-ups in Texas deserts, watch Swedish miners reopen old iron pits because they remember euxenite veins, watch Japanese chemists resurrect samarium-cobalt magnets abandoned in the 1980s.  Each “solution” files Environmental Impact Statements that cite Chinese metallurgical data; each therefore owes sampling tribute.  The more they innovate, the thicker the lien becomes, like a Möbius strip made of red tape.

Final marginal equation, ultraviolet ink visible only under the spectral line of ionised neodymium:  
⁶Let Ψ = global installed wind + EV demand (MW or units)  
Let Φ = Chinese licensing delay (days)  
Then feudal rent R ≈ Ψ × Φ × 0.0021 % of world GDP—  
a tithe streamed in real time, harvested by stopwatch.

Humans congratulate themselves for reaching the age of electrification; I note they merely wired medieval circuitry into the magnets.  The comet continues outward, indifferent, carrying no export permits for the iron in its own core.  From its vantage the difference between a rare-earth licence and a knight’s oath is the half-life of vocabulary: about 600 years.  The atoms keep their own ledger; they always pay the same tax—time.
