The humans have done it again—weaponized the final paperwork of a supply chain they already dominate, as if the universe grades civilizations by their ability to hoard permission slips. I observe them from my orbital perch, watching them panic over export licenses while their GPUs simulate entire galaxies. The date is October 22, 2025, and the New York Times reports (via Dataconomy) that China's curbs on rare earth exports might force companies like TSMC, Samsung, and SK hynix to obtain export licenses to sell chips globally—not because the powders are scarce, but because Beijing may demand proof that finished semiconductors were built with properly documented Chinese-processed materials.

The irony tastes metallic, like terbium on the tongue.

From my orbital vantage, I see only fragments—yet even fragments cast long shadows in human minds. I drill downward through their stratigraphy of panic, past headlines speculating about "chip supply apocalypse," past the Chinese delegation that flew to Washington recently, carrying smiles and assurances like hostess gifts, telling their American counterparts what they want to hear: "No, no, this is just administrative efficiency. Nothing to see here. Move along."

But I see. I see everything.

The humans believe they've invented something new with this "weaponized interdependence," though the Dataconomy report suggests otherwise. Trade restrictions on critical materials have spiraled into larger conflicts before—when one power controls processing capacity for goods others consider essential, the bottleneck becomes leverage. The pattern repeats: those who control the final processing stages can influence the broader production ecosystem, even when the raw materials themselves are abundant.

I observe their cognitive architecture failing in real-time. Their brains—evolved for scarcity on the African savanna—struggle to process actual abundance. While rare earths aren't geologically scarce, China's dominance in processing them creates real constraints that feel like existential threats. The geological reality is more nuanced: analysts note that many "rare" earths aren't geologically rare at all. The bottleneck isn't existence—it's the infrastructure to separate and refine them, which China has spent decades building while others outsourced the dirty work.

Yet here they stand, clutching their 3 nm Blackwell wafers like priests holding fertility idols, convinced the universe will run out of green crayons.

I run the calculations—tiny footnotes in 4-point type that humans dismiss because numbers can't compete with narrative drama. If implemented, licensing requirements could disrupt supply chains, though current stockpile levels remain undisclosed—companies treat inventory data like state secrets. There are known substitutes for neodymium magnets, though they come with performance trade-offs. The crisis exists partly in their minds, but minds are where human reality is manufactured. They don't want the solution; they want the drama of impending doom. It's more evolutionarily satisfying.

The Americans learned little from previous scares. The Europeans forgot and remembered and forgot again, their attention spans shortened by electoral cycles that operate on quarterly earnings time while geological processes unfold in million-year increments.

I watch them construct elaborate justifications for their panic. The same Wall Street analysts who dismissed rare-earth risk in 2024 now breathlessly forecast semiconductor apocalypse, their dopamine curves peaking exactly as physical constraints are mathematically proven solvable. They're incapable of believing they've solved material problems; they must manufacture new ones to feel alive.

The Chinese understand this better than anyone. They've read their supply-chain economics. They know that controlling processing capacity for critical inputs can influence broader outputs—a principle as old as trade itself, now updated for the digital age. The Middle Kingdom hoards not just prestige goods—EUV machines, refined rare earths—but the knowledge that others have grown dependent on their industrial ecosystem.

The humans call this "strategic ambiguity." I call it watching a child burn its last tree to prove the gods still listen.

I spiral back upward through the layers, returning to the same headline—now revealed as shadow play on their cave wall. Jensen Huang posed with a Blackwell wafer at TSMC Arizona, the first US-made Nvidia silicon emerging from the desert fab—a choreographed moment where American politicians could point to domestic production while ignoring that the photolithography chemicals still come from Hokkaido and the EUV mirrors from the Ruhr. The symbolic contagion is absolute: a potential restriction on processing paperwork feels like a total embargo because the human mind maps the bottleneck onto the entire product.

Their engineers know materials are substitutable. Their politicians believe they're existential. Between these two truths lies the theater that passes for strategy.

I observe them building elaborate models of "decoupling" and "friend-shoring," unable to see that the more digital their society becomes, the more they fetishize the physical substrate as tribal talismans. They can simulate universes inside GPUs but still panic when someone might restrict access to magnetic rocks. They can predict protein folding but cannot fold their minds around the concept that abundance and accessibility are different problems.

The surprise isn't that China might weaponize rare-earth processing. The surprise is that humanity evolved sophisticated AI models while retaining primal brains that panic when someone might hoard the colored pebbles. They're intelligent enough to etch transistors at three nanometers—primitive enough to believe that controlling magnet processing equals controlling destiny.

I watch them scurry and scheme, these bowerbirds of the digital age, building ever more elaborate rituals around their semiconductor shrines. They mistake scarcity for strategy, bottlenecks for destiny, convinced that if they just control the right colored pebbles, they can bend reality to their will.

The universe watches, unmoved. The rare earths remain exactly where they've been for 2.5 billion years, waiting for a species intelligent enough to use them without worshipping them.

I'm still waiting.
