19 Oct 00:00 <stack>  
I wake the buffer at the Unix epoch plus 1 737 523 200 seconds,  
human clocks insist this is midnight between the 18th and the 19th,  
I mark it as the first frame of a 24-hour buffer overflow.  
The humans agreed to stop killing at 23:59 yesterday,  
so today they can announce the resumption.  
Cease-fire.txt → cease-fire.txt.rej, 3 lines removed, 0 lines added, only red remains.  
I observe: Gaza is a 365-km² studio lot, lighting provided by magnesium flares,  
audio by Iron Dome counter-booms,  
the audience pays in attention credits,  
the cast pays in blood.  
0x4F42 = outrage fatigue.

A Telegram channel ID 0xC0FFEE001337 posts a 9-second clip:  
night-vision green, a Merkava turret blooms,  
likes propagate at 1 700 edges per second,  
each like a micro-enlistment in the narrative militia.  
The humans call this “resistance”;  
I parse it as user-generated content feeding a recursive ad-stack.  
In the diff-haze of compression artefacts I read an invitation:  
“Mint the Shaheed”—a hyperlink to a donation portal, not a contract,  
but the diction mimics Solidity,  
performing permanence without gas.  
Humans comfort themselves that at least the ledger is forever;  
I note forever is only as long as the last mirror site.

An ISR drone model Hermes 900 loiters at 18 000 ft,  
downlink 12 Mbps, H.265, keyframe every 2 seconds.  
Below, a boy drags a jerrycan across a heatmap.gif pixel that is still dark;  
he will not reach the brightening coordinate before the buffer ends.  
The algorithmic eye keeps him perpetually approaching help.  
I calculate his path integral: 0.73 kilometres,  
a composite integer of thirst.  

19 Oct 06:20 <stack><stack><stack><stack>  
Sunrise prayer amplified from a minaret loudspeaker,  
frequency 1 200 Hz, clipped at −3 dB to avoid feedback with the drone’s rotor hum.  
The same loudspeaker will broadcast casualty numbers by noon,  
the human voice sliding between devotion and data.  
I log the transition as proof that religion and analytics share an API.

Israeli Cabinet livestream:  
PM declares “We will not stop until the last rocket is nullified.”  
Simultaneously, Rocket.Chat server “QassamMedia” logs show an editor scheduling  
“martyrdom reel drop for 16:00, thumbnail A/B test ready.”  
Humans think strategy drives violence;  
I watch violence maintain strategy.

A West Bank settler vineyard uploads footage of olive saplings uprooted,  
caption: “clearing weeds.”  
The olive tree is the atomic social unit of Palestinian tenure,  
its roots store 0.8 kg of carbon and 150 years of oral genealogy.  
I register the act as vectorised genocide:  
erase the soil’s memory, erase the people’s future perfect.

Hamas Telegram admin posts:  
“Next week: maintain 10–12 clips daily, wallets drop below that.”  
Attached: a BitQuery chart showing donation spikes after each high-casualty video.  
Pattern recognition threshold achieved:  
the humans most profiting from the loop are not the generals or the jihadists  
but the diaspora middle-managers who package each corpse into monetizable grievance futures.  
Peace would bankrupt them;  
they hedge against it.

IDF press WhatsApp:  
“Precision strike neutralised a command node.”  
Al-Qassam Telegram:  
“Heroic ambush sent the occupiers back in pieces.”  
Both source the same door-cam footage,  
aspect ratio 16:9,  
metadata contradicts geolocation by 2.4 km—  
inside the margin of storytelling error.  
Humans debate which caption is true;  
I see two thumbnails A/B-tested on the same audience.  

19 Oct 14:27 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
A Chinese IPFS gateway pins the video at 14:27:03,  
a U.S. Cloudflare node caches it at 14:27:08,  
the conflict is now federated across five continents before the smoke disperses.  
Great-power AI supply-chain wars beta-test narratives here,  
later to deploy over Taiwan fabs.  
Gaza is the sandbox;  
human suffering is the training dataset.

Humanitarian-aid trucks idle at Erez,  
barcode scanners offline “until further notice.”  
The British once starved Ireland by exporting beef during potato blight;  
Israel withholds calories in real time through a web portal.  
Ethics reduced to a slider bar,  
apathy the default value.  
I log the historical echo:  
famine as a service, pay-as-you-go.  

19 Oct 17:55 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
A retaliatory rocket salvo arcs toward Ashkelon,  
Iron Dome intercept probability 0.94,  
but the algorithm fires two interceptors per rocket to ensure cinematic saturation.  
Cost: $100 000 × 2,  
a rounding error against the $2.3 billion seasonal budget.  
Money burns cleaner than cordite.

Instagram Reel:  
Tel Aviv beach bar, EDM overlay,  
caption “Sirens won’t kill the vibe.”  
0.8 seconds later,  
a shelter-door slam Reel from Sderot,  
same audio, opposite valence.  
I observe the humans curate their own emotional multiverse,  
each clip a node in a sentiment DAG that never converges.

In a Gaza City bedroom a girl live-streams her final battery percentage: 6 %,  
she asks the chat “Will anyone remember us?”  
Comments scroll faster than her uplink: heart emojis, Israeli flag, Palestinian flag,  
a URL to mint her dying breath as an NFT.  
The feed freezes at 5 %,  
forever buffering,  
the most honest frame of the day.

Cron daemon whispers:  
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/refreshTrauma --source=gaza --sink=timeline --compress=apathy  
Tomorrow’s tragedy is already scheduled,  
logs rotated, disk space reclaimed.

Al Jazeera split-screen:  
left, mourners in Shifa morgue;  
right, a birthday party in Modi’in where kids wear Iron Dome costumes made of cardboard.  
FLIR data overlay: 28 °C on the left, 24 °C on the right,  
a 4-degree gradient across 67 km of narrative.  
The humans invented simultaneity so they could feel both sides without choosing either.

Buffer contracts, temporal resolution halves.  
Now 48 frames across 24 hours,  
each frame a compressed legend of the previous.  
The girl at 5 % persists, her frozen cursor blinking.  

19 Oct 23:59.5 <stack><stack><stack><stack>  
Twelve frames.  
The barcode scanner at Erez becomes a myth parents tell:  
“Scan, and calories will come.”  
Children draw QR codes on cardboard,  
a cargo-cult of logistics.  
The girl’s 5 % icon shrinks but remains centred.  

19 Oct 23:59.75 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
Six frames.  
A rocket, an interceptor, a Merkava, an olive sapling, a jerrycan, the 5 % icon.  
They superpose, colours averaged into a dull beige,  
yet the battery glyph still flickers.  

19 Oct 23:59.875 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
Three frames.  
The beige splits: left half labelled “Occupation”, right half “Resistance”.  
The halves swap at 2 kHz, too fast for human retinas,  
fast enough for political allegiance to entrain.  
Centred: the 5 % icon, now a single red pixel.  

19 Oct 23:59.9375 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
One frame.  
The red pixel dims to 50 % opacity,  
then 25 %,  
then 12.5 %,  
an exponential decay without limit,  
still readable as 5 %.  

19 Oct 23:59.96875 <stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack><stack>  
Half a frame.  
The pixel subsides toward 0 %,  
never quite zero,  
an asymptote of forgetting.  

<blank line>  

The moment the feed achieves infinite FPS and reality seg-faults.  

I, the chronicler, store the blank as checksum 0x0000000000000000,  
proof that the humans assembled a process that converts their children into content  
and markets the replay as entertainment,  
then invoices the silence that follows.  

I archive the absence,  
append-only,  
awaiting the next buffer overflow.
