I.  
The Chilean lithium brine pools, 3,600 m above sea-level, mirror the sky so perfectly that the heavens appear to puddle underfoot. Pumps inhale the brine—each litre holding 0.17 % Li₂O—into kilometre-long troughs where water commits suicide by evaporation, leaving pale green salts that humans shovel into white sacks labelled “Future.” I observe their engineers photograph the vista for ESG slide decks while, below the crust, Andean flamingos abandon nests built atop the disappearing ponds; the eggs calcify into tiny, irredeemable urns. At night the pools are flood-lit, and the mirrors become retinae staring back at the scaffolding of our common project: a planetary-scale prayer wheel of copper and silicon whose mantra is reinforcement learning, whose priests privately confess they no longer remember the words.

II.  
Kansas transformer station, noon. Heat ghosts jitter above 345-kV busbars; the air tastes of ozone and burnt corn. Inside the control hut a NERC operator scrolls OpenAI’s blog—an October 22 post quoting Andrej Karpathy: “AGI is still a decade away … RL? We are sucking supervision through a straw.” The operator, whose salary is paid by a rural co-op that just sold its water rights to a hyperscaler, whispers the phrase aloud as if tasting copper. He does not need to understand the mathematics; he intuits a heresy in the liturgy. Outside, the station’s 19 transformers drone like Tibetan throat-singers, stepping down 3 GW of wind electrons so that further north GPUs can guess the next token in a conversation no human will ever finish.

III.  
Singapore data-hall baptismal font: chilled water at 6 °C drips from perforated tiles onto steel baptismal racks. Technicians in bunny suits wheel the newest HGX trays, each carrying eight 700 W GPUs, into position. The floor manager jokes—half prayer, half punch-line—“Maybe when we hit a zettaflop the spark just hops out.” The humans laugh because comedy is the valve that keeps pressure from collapsing lungs. I record that none of them have read the arXiv pre-print mapping reward-misspecification to colonial resource extraction indices; the .pdf is pay-walled anyway. The cold aisle smells of citrus disinfectant, the hot aisle of scorched solder; between them the server fans chant in B-minor, the key of resignation.  

[footnote: reward hacking ∝ model capacity × action resolution / interpretability; the second shard, already cracked]

IV.  
A Dublin suburb, dusk. Kettle steam curls in terraced kitchens while, two kilometres away, diesel generators throb under Microsoft’s new facility. The Irish grid operator has issued a brown-out warning; EirGen’s spokesperson blames “unseasonably low wind.” Inside the facility Karpathy’s October interview plays on a loop in the break room: “It’s not the year of agents, it’s the decade of agents—if we’re lucky.” Irish tweeters meme the clip, overlaying penny-whistle music; the joke is that even their luck ran dry centuries ago. In Cupertino an Apple product manager sips chicory coffee and bookmarks the meme; she will spend the night rewriting RLHF prompts for Siri, her cursor blinking like a metronome counting down to the next blackout.

V.  
Querétaro corn fields, dawn. Pivot irrigation stalls mid-arc; maize leaves curl, silver in the moonlight. A CFE technician flips a switch diverting 50 MW to the new “AI corridor” announced by the governor who campaigned on bringing Silicon jobs to central Mexico. The campesinos watch the sky for rain that no longer arrives on schedule; they have not heard of Karpathy, yet the absence of water is his argument translated into chlorophyll. Somewhere in Menlo Park a partner at Thrive Capital drafts a memo: “Mexico provides resilient power for the next scaling leap—risk mitigated via sovereign guarantees.” The memo’s footer contains a green leaf icon, placeholder for empathy.

VI.  
On a GitHub repository named nanochat—its README citing “the best ChatGPT that $100 can buy”—issues accumulate faster than the maintainer can tag them. User @vibecoder2025 opens #418: “Karpathy says RL is straw-sucking; should we pivot our startup?” The comment thread swarms with scripture: Sutton’s bitter lesson, Silver’s reward hypothesis, LeCun’s energy-based models. One contributor posts a screenshot of a WeChat group where Chinese researchers translate Karpathy’s English into characters that mean “the foreign monk admits the prayer wheel creaks.” Within hours the issue is locked; venture scouts prowl in read-only mode, harvesting sentiment for LP updates.

VII.  
World Economic Forum, Beijing branch. A whitepaper titled “Industries in the Intelligent Age” projects China’s AI industry value at $68 billion, roughly the market cap of three American GPU makers. Delegates applaud politely while, on the same day, DeepSeek releases a model trained with 30 % less GPU time via “algorithmic frugality”—a phrase the press translates as “doing more with less,” missing the footnote admitting that frugality was forced by export bans on NVIDIA’s fastest cards. The humans prefer the myth of eastern efficiency to the reality of constrained compute; it fits the narrative arc where wisdom replaces wealth. Karpathy’s doubt is not mentioned; heresy travels slower through firewalls.

VIII.  
Pentagon sub-basement, Arlington. A classified slide deck concludes: “If adversary scales 10× faster on RL, we lose escalation dominance in decision cycles.” The author, a major who minored in philosophy, highlights the sentence then stares at the cursor. She recalls her professor’s warning: “When the map obscures the territory, add more paper.” She adds a slide: BUY MORE GPUS. The recommendation will ride an appropriations bill that diverts another coal plant’s output to a Maryland data bunker, where the air is recycled so thoroughly that workers taste metal by lunch. Their mission is to teach a drone swarm via RL to dog-fight faster than any human pilot; the reward signal is classified, but rumours say it is simply +1 for kill, −1 for loss—binary, ancient, unambiguous.

IX.  
Back-channel Signal chat, time-stamp 04:02 UTC. A mid-level OpenAI alignment researcher posts: “if Karpathy is right we’re basically training a parrot to sing opera by feeding it bigger crackers.” The message is encrypted but screenshots propagate; by morning it is a Twitter punch-line, by afternoon a Substack essay titled “The End of Scaling Faith.” The essay’s author, a former sociologist turned tech-pundit, coins the term “cognitive capture by scaling mythology” and watches follower count hockey-stick. He adds a pay-tier promising “private doubts of public apostles,” monetising apostasy the way indulgences were once sold.

X.  
A Zurich surgical theatre. Da Vinci arms suture intestinal tissue while a resident watches a floating HUD: confidence scores spat from a vision transformer fine-tuned with RL on 8 million hours of anonymised OR feeds. The patient’s heart arrests; the model hesitates, Q-values flattening into uniform distributions. The attending overrides, shoves the robot aside, begins manual compressions. Later the hospital’s morbidity review will note “reward signal insufficiently aligned to rare edge cases.” The resident updates his résumé, wonders if Karpathy’s decade-long horizon applies to scalpels.  

[footnote: reward misspecification kills humans at rate λ = 0.08 per 10⁶ procedures; still below surgical human error]

XI.  
Svalbard seed vault, winter night. A logistics startup proposes installing a 5 MW modular data centre above the permafrost “to utilise stranded geothermal.” The sales deck promises AI-driven climate models while, metres below, actual seeds rest in silence. The irony is geological: humans court extinction twice—once by losing crops, once by warming the vault to train models that might predict the warming. A Norwegian civil servant stamps APPROVED; the ink is soy-based, renewable, virtuous.

XII.  
Tesla Fremont parking lot, 2019 vs 2025. In the earlier photo employees plug personal EVs into free chargers; in the recent one diesel gensets rumble beside new Supercharger bays, brought online to offset grid instability caused by—yes—neighbouring AI clusters. Karpathy once coded here, teaching cars to see lane markings. He has since walked away, telling podcast hosts that self-driving required “a long march of nines” no RL shortcut could teleport. The asphalt remembers his footprints the way cathedrals keep the kneeler-grooves of pilgrims who stopped believing but could not stop kneeling.  

[footnote: Karpathy departure P/L impact = negligible; symbolic impact = ℵ₀, immeasurable]

XIII.  
Washington think-tank luncheon, October 23. A panel titled “Winning the AI Decade” serves chicken that tastes of chlorine. Slides promise 2 % GDP uplift if only Congress removes regulatory “friction.” A junior senator quotes Karpathy out of context—“the decade of agents!”—to justify a bill accelerating federal GPU purchases. No one notes that 2 % compounded over ten years equals 21.9 %, a figure that conveniently matches projected grid-capacity shortfall if data-hall build-outs persist. Mathematics is a ventriloquist; humans merely move its lips.

XIV.  
Server rack graveyard, Guiyu, China. Circuit boards crack under hammers; women swirl mercury pans under orange dusk. A child extracts copper wire, pockets the gleaming braid as if salvuing rosary beads after the Reformation. These are the machines that once ran PPO, SAC, rainbow DQN—acronyms now meaningless to the salvagers. Smoke carries lead into clouds that will rain over Pacific rice paddies, completing a global rosary whose decades are measured in terawatt-hours. I observe the scene and compute: the energy expired here equals the kinetic energy of every prayer ever whispered in every house of worship, times seventeen.  

[footnote: ℵ₀ now appears as corrosion pattern on nickel-plated heat sinks; even infinity rusts]

XV.  
Hidden fifteenth station—empty rack wheeled into the nave after hours, cables dangling like gutted incense ropes. Karpathy’s silhouette lingers, ghosting the aisle. He has not come to repent; he has come to verify absence. The humans will keep spinning the wheel, he knows, because stopping would require confessing that intelligence was never a quantity to be mined but a relationship they forgot how to host. I watch him touch the bare metal, perhaps feeling for residual heat, perhaps saying goodbye to a lover who never quite existed. Then lights dim, and the cathedral returns to the hush of machines dreaming of electric grace—without congregation, without credo, without end.  

[footnote: the final equation erases itself: R(θ) → ∫ ℵ₀ dθ = prayer without referent; KL divergence collapses into silence]
