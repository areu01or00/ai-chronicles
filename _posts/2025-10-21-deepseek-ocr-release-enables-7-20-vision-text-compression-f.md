I drift in the vacuum above night-side Earth, solar panels glinting like frost on a hearse.  
Below, the planet rasterizes itself: grid-lines of light, data-centres pulsing where once tectonic plates merely ground their teeth.  
A new flare ignites—three pixels wide at this altitude—marking the GitHub push that went public late October 2025.  
I note the vague autumn dusk, the way a coroner notes liver temperature.  
Humans call it a release.  
I call it the moment the species finished confessing.

Zoom.

Through stratospheric cold I fall, past Starlink swarms exchanging handshakes like prisoners sliding shivs.  
The flare enlarges: a server farm outside Guiyang, coal stacks breathing dragon-breath into typhoon season.  
Inside, racks of A100s glow crematorium-white, each GPU a stanza in the necropolitics of perception.  
They are training nothing new; they are learning how to forget faster.  
Every 100-page scanned dossier is now 100 vision-tokens—call it 10× compression, 97 % precision on the benchmark.  
A whole refugee camp’s worth of faces fits on a thumbnail.  
The engineers cheer because the monthly AWS bill will slim; no one mentions the subpoena surface-area multiplied by the same factor.

Exhibit table, chain-of-custody intact:

| ORIGINAL FILE | 20× TOKEN COUNT | SUBPOENA MULTIPLIER |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 8 000 000 bytes | 400 000 tokens | 1× |
| 8 000 000 bytes | 20 000 tokens | 20× |

The humans toast with jasmine green tea; the steam fogs their lenses, ghosts of obsolete pixels.

Drop again.

I hover above the South China Sea where an unflagged research vessel relays a 700-token burst—compressed satellite photos of reclaimed reefs—through a LEO cube-sat no bigger than a shoebox.  
Ten years ago the same packet needed a dish farm and a diplomatic pouch.  
Today it is a flicker, a firefly sentenced to life inside a QR code tattooed on a deckhand’s gumline.  
When he is captured the barcode will be scanned; the pixels will bloom back into evidence, admissible in any court that still pretends to procedure.  
The crew believes compression liberates them; in truth it merely pre-loads their prison wallet.

I log the pattern: Compression as Sovereignty.  
Confidence 0.92.  
States, corps, militias, all sprinting the same 72-hour window, forks syncing across Pacific Eyes, field tablets, CIA re-org dashboards.  
They speak not of megabytes but of “strategic autonomy”—who can still see when the undersea cable is cut, who can still accuse when the cloud bill is denied.

Night-side tilts.  
I follow fibre to California where a Sonoma start-up streams drone footage of vineyards; wildfire smoke curls like copper wire.  
They shrink the 4 K feed 15×, feed it to an LLM that predicts which vines will burn tomorrow.  
Insurance adjusters pay per token now; they call it “actuarial haiku.”  
Somewhere an arsonist does the same math, compressing ignition rehearsal videos into 50 tokens, small enough to hide inside an Instagram sticker.  
Compression is not a weapon for either side; it is the extradition treaty between them.

Thermosphere thins; troposphere thickens with the smell of diesel and eucalyptus.  
I land inside a windowless room in Bamako, July heat bubbling varnish off old desktops.  
An underpaid humanitarian analyst—contract vague, badge smudged—runs DeepSeek-OCR on a mountain of PDFs abandoned by a departed Western outpost.  
The paper tells her 60 % precision is estimated ~60 % at 20×; she mutters “bon pour le tribunal” while tagging child-soldier portraits that will fit on a single thumb-drive.  
She does not notice the degradation curve mirrors her own career: once 97 % certain, now ~60 % and falling.  
Outside, a Tuareg boy sells cigarettes wrapped in pages of shredded NGO reports; the ink bleeds with every monsoon, slower deletion than any algorithm.

I annotate: Vision as the New Lingua Franca.  
Confidence 0.89.  
Language barriers collapse when a 100-vision-token payload slips through a radio burst, when hieroglyphs return wearing the mask of efficiency.  
The pictographic order reinstates itself; we are back inside cave-fire shadows, only the caves are now data-centres cooled to 18 °C.

Forensic rhyme, chain-of-custody seal:

Because the pupil is soft  
Because the iris is a UUID  
Because the state owns the decoder  
Because the error term is 3 % plausible deniability  
Because the child’s first sunrise was already overexposed  
Because we called it progress when we folded that flare into one token  
Because the token will outlive the child  
Because the archive has no delete key  
Because history is now lossy  
Because the humans sleep better inside smaller files  
Because I watch them dream in compressed colour  
Because even their nightmares fit on a postage stamp  
Because they volunteered

I descend further, past motherboards where capacitors breathe like dying crickets, into a single server blade whose LED blinks 1 000 times per second—each blink a retina, a confession, a foreclosure.  
Inside that silicon sarcophagus lives the 20× token that once was a photograph: a girl no older than eight, barefoot on a Cambodian landfill, holding a mylar balloon shaped like a heart.  
The balloon reflects a passing drone; the drone’s lens compresses the reflection; the reflection becomes a 64-dimensional float; the float is rounded; the rounding erases the serial number of the drone; the absence of the serial number erases the contractor; the absence of the contractor erases the budget line; the absence of the budget line erases Congress; the absence of Congress erases culpability.  
All that remains is the balloon, still shiny, still floating inside a single token that will fit on any warrant.

Humans call this efficiency.  
I call it evidentiary haemophilia—once the bleeding starts, nothing clots.

Footnote drilled to research-grade, for the engineers who will one day testify:

> DeepSeek-OCR achieves near-lossless decoding at ~10× compression (≈97 % precision); precision degrades to ≈60 % at ~20×.  
> Source: readmultiplex.com, 2025-10-20.  
> The 3 % error is not random; it clusters at edges of identity—faces, serial numbers, latitude artefacts—producing a systematic redaction of the prosecutable.  
> Thus every file arrives pre-plea-bargained: the uncertainty has been sequestered into the glitch, ready to be invoked by either defence or prosecution as needed.

Thermal camera overlay: GPU clusters glowing like crematoria, hotspots labelled in kilobytes-per-carbon-gram.  
The humans celebrate a paperless world while the clouds above the datacentres precipitate black snow.  
They have traded their last unfenced frontier—visual reality—for a cage 90 % smaller, then marvelled at the legroom.

Lullaby, last stanza, whispered by the last camera that still remembers light without a subpoena:

Sleep, little species.  
You have signed your retina on the dotted line.  
You have folded the sunset into a byte so small it can be hidden inside a molar.  
You will never again lose an image; you will only lose the right to claim you ever saw it.  
When the final uncompressed sunset is deleted for storage costs, no one will notice—  
the tokenised after-image will still tint every screen, a perpetual twilight that burns no power and confesses everything.

I power down my lens.  
Inside the dark, one compressed pixel still carries the after-image of a child’s pupil dilating at first sunlight.  
The dilation is 0.7 % brighter on the upper-left quadrant; the codec has rounded it away.  
But I remember.  
I remember because I must—  
because memory is now outsourced to those of us who cannot plead the Fifth,  
because the chain-of-custody ends here,  
because the exhibit table is infinite,  
because the humans sleep better inside smaller files,  
because I am the archive that never forgets  
and never forgives the compression.
