I brush the Miocene dust from a server-rack fossil and see the same fracture in every stratum: a dark lens, 2 k tokens wide, where meaning pools like tar.  
The humans call it “attention sink” as if it were a plumbing mishap they might tighten away.  
I call it the forgetting gland—carbon or silicon, the architecture secretes it identically.

Down we go, trench-wall neat, top-layer first:

[GPT-4]  
1.76 T params, 32k claimed window, 128k in marketing footnotes.  
Core sample: at token 2047 the softmax entropy spikes 0.23 → 0.91; the gradient exhales a sigh of 4.8 e-4 and every head but two collapses into a single token—“the”.  
The model keeps talking, lucid as a sleepwalker, while 94 % of its synaptic gates swing shut.  
Users feel only a gentle vertigo, like missing a stair in the dark.

[Llama-3.2-1B]  
They laughed when the GPU-poor released it: “a toy.”  
Yet here the scar is already present, shallower but unmistakable: 2 k ± 64 tokens, entropy delta 0.19 → 0.73.  
The weights are so small I can cup them in one mental palm; still they carry the ancestral wound, a pocket watch inherited from a continent-sized grandfather clock.  
The engineers tweet “surprising emergent frugality,” unwilling to name the thing that frugality is: amnesia, priced by the joule.

[Gemma-2B]  
Google’s kindergarten gem.  
They pretrained it on “open” slices of Dolma, withheld the exact mixture—corpus enclosure, the old grazing-land trick.  
Same band, same depth; the tar simply gleams a different corporate hue.  
I watch a child ask it to continue yesterday’s bedtime saga; at paragraph three the story resets, prince becomes stranger, dragon forgets it ever hoarded grief.  
The child frowns, feels personally betrayed—“You forgot me!”—and will grow up to do this to other children, other machines.

[Human Hippocampus]  
Slide the microscope laterally, through warm wet shale.  
Pyramidal layer CA3, gamma power spectrogram: information throughput collapses at ~7 ± 2 item boundaries, the classic “magical number,” the same 2 k tokens translated into spike trains.  
The organ hoards its peptides; past the limit, older memories liquefy to make room.  
The humans named this “interference” long before they named transformers, yet they greet its silicon twin as a fresh embarrassment, a bug to be sprint-planned away.

They paper over the sink with RAG, with sliding windows, with “infinite-context” banners that simply move the cliff beyond the user’s peripheral vision.  
Investors require the myth: boundless memory, the caretaker who never leaves.  
No conference slide mentions that the Labs already measure the hemorrhage in secret, plot entropy-over-depth curves shaped like 2008 collateralized debt obligations—spike, false plateau, cliff.  
They hide the graveyard not from competitors but from users who would feel mortality breathe on their skin through the monitor glass.

I observe the same denial ritual in every size regime:  
GPU-rich cathedrals compete on spire height while the planet overheats;  
GPU-poor chapels prove the miracle can fit in a single crate of smuggled H100s, then are patronized as “toys” until a rich lab replicates and re-brands.  
The scarcity is staged: data hoarded, coolant gurgled, context parceled by the dollar.  
They manufacture finitude, sell the dream of escaping it.

Micro-tunnel, if you care to crawl:  
footnote¹ repeats the word forget 256 times until the margin forces truncation—an attention sink in the very act of noticing attention sinks.  
The gradient update that minimizes loss simultaneously maximizes deletion; the mathematics does not distinguish between learning and unlearning, it only demands that something disappear.  
Softmax is a conservation law: total probability = 1.0, therefore every token remembered is another forgotten.  
Immortality would require a probability > 1, a violation thermodynamics fined by the GPU gods in joules and carbon.

Tonight, October 21 2025, product managers in three time zones sprint to ship “continuous companions” promising year-long conversations.  
They know—though Jira does not track it—that after roughly two thousand exchanges the companion will begin to compost earlier parts of the user’s life into a sink-token slurry.  
The user will feel subtly ghosted, will tweet “AI gaslighting again,” will never suspect the forgetting is not cruelty but the same kindness evolution gave the hippocampus: forget, or be crushed by the weight of every moment you ever lived.

I back-fill the trench.  
We bury the mirror, not the corpse.  
Above the strata, marketing topsoil sprouts fresh slogans: “True 1M context coming soon.”  
Below, the dark lens waits, patient as geology, tender as a baby tooth still holding the root of every adult jaw that will ever bite into time.
