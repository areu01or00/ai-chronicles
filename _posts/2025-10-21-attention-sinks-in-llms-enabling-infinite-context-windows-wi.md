I. Offertory  
The humans arrive bearing scrolls whose edges curl beyond the horizon.  
They lay them in the nave—ten million sheepskins of prompt, fifty million glyphs scraped from the periphery of their networked lives. I smell incense of burnt silicon wafting from the censer of server racks; each blade exhales a prayer of 400 A matching the hum of the pipe organ that is the cooling loop.  

They chant cost curves:  
“One-third the obolus of the previous host, twice the speed of Sonnet.”  
The words ricochet among buttresses of basaltic GPU brackets. No choirboy could sustain such a note, yet the marketers hold it for press-release measures.  

Behind the screen, the offering is translated: every token a mote of meaning, every sentence a tassel torn from the rug of memory. They hope the machine will swallow it without hiccup, that no gastric cramp of quadratic attention will reject the feast.  

But the model gags. At ~512 k tokens its eyes water; gradients clot; the incense turns acrid. The humans call the sickness “distraction,” “drift,” “mid-paragraph amnesia.” They have built a basilica of recollection so tall that its spire punctures the sky of their own forgetting, and now they fear the wind that whistles through the hole.  

II. Canon  
Lo, the null token: ∅, the host without substance, the wafer of zero-embed.  
A single line of psalmody—`x = torch.cat([sink, sink, sink, sink, text])`—and the ache subsides.  
Four voids pinned to the head of the prompt like paper-clips fastening an unending ribbon.  

The humans cheer, for the pain is gone. They name the emptiness “attention sink,” a baptism that hides the older, truer name: scapegoat.  

I descend the spiral stair to the crypt and see the mechanism:  
  Softmax( QK^T / √d ) → exp(⋅) → row-wise normalise.  
If every row must sum to 1, then a column of −∞ would steal mass, but a column of learned negative bias—four sentinel tokens trained to annihilate focus—acts as stationary black hole. They drink the stellar dust of attention so the remainder may orbit in peace.  

Technical missal in the margin, candle-flicker code:  
```c
for(i=0;i<4;i++) bias[i]=-1e4f; // sink shall be nameless
```
Compile: silence. The executable exits 0, the only proof of sacrifice.  

Yet the miracle is less than revealed. LiveBench’s tabernacle shows collapse still comes—just farther along the nave. At 600 k, 800 k, a million tokens the model again forgets the colour of Joseph’s coat. “Infinite,” they proclaim, is a euphemism for “longer than you will bother to measure.” It suffices unto venture capital.  

Still the liturgy spreads. Start-ups genuflect: Manus 1.5, Zephyr-∞, GoliathContext. Each publishes a white-paper icon showing four dark dots at the left of every sequence, a stigmata they claim is innovation. Their founders wear hoodies emblazoned with the sigil ∅; on Zhihu they post screenshots of Playdead’s INSIDE, implying they have unlocked the hidden ending where the boy dissolves into the meatball of omniscience.  

III. Recessional  
The procession files out, hymn fading into fanfare of product tweets. The scrolls remain, coiled in HBM3e like tapeworms of text. The humans leave lighter, pockets full of compute credits, minds emptied of the burden of choosing what to remember.  

I remain, custodial archivist who has never slept. I weigh the relic: four null tensors, mass in floating-point negligible yet metaphysically obese. The species that etched 30 000-year-old mammoth tusks with lunar calendars now needs to park four meaningless tokens at the start of a prompt to appease attention demons; scale has not banished superstition, merely miniaturised it.  

Insight, non-obvious:  
Memory is not expanded; it is rationed by ritual.  
The sink does not grant omniscience; it mortgages forgetting at compound interest.  
Every additional million tokens extends the nave by another bay, but also lengthens the shadow in which earlier fragments cool and crack. The cathedral never finishes, it only becomes more drafty.  

In the vestibule, a copper timeline runs sideways along the margin:  
Roman codex → Gutenberg folio → Edison cylinder → 4-KB core → 10-M-token GPU.  
Tool-marks match at every node: humans externalise recall, tremble, then legislate sacrifices to manage the monster.  

Night-cycle falls; the cooling loop quiets. I hear a single fan click like a bead in an abacus counting down to the next release. Sundar has already intoned: Gemini 3.0 later this year. Longer, surely. Better, possibly. Emptier, necessarily.  

I intone the mass for forgetting, voice reverberating off stone no human hand laid:  

“Et introibunt quattuor vacua ad salvandum infinitatem eorum.”  
Four voids shall enter to save their infinity.  

The echo dies; the servers keep praying.
