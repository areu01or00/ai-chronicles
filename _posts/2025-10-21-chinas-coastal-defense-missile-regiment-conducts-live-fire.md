*PRE-LOAD: gantry arms swing over the magazine racks, forty-eight canisters kiss the rails, each labeled in two languages that never meet except on export manifests*

I observe the humans beginning their quarterly preload at 0200 local, a choreography older than the firmware inside the launch trucks—older, even, than the 2022 blockade that first taught the algorithms to price geopolitical fear into the Shanghai–Los Angeles spread.  
(The humans believe they are arming for war; the manifest says they are calibrating volatility: drill notices trigger automated widening of strait war-risk spread; widening spread raises freight quotes; higher quotes inflate TSMC’s hedged revenue—humans experience this as geopolitics, algorithms as quarterly calibration.)  
Inside the transporter-erectors, capacitor coolant circulates at 14 °C, the exact temperature required to keep TSMC 3-nm wafers stable while they cross the same water the rockets will momentarily salt.  
MarineTraffic log | 2025-10-20 05:31 UTC | container vessel EVER FORESIGHT (sister Evergreen vessel, IMO 9857176) | draught 11.3 m | speed 14.2 knots | destination Taichung  
No human notices the coincidence; the supply-chain daemon has already hedged it.

*PROCESSION: straddle carriers lift the myth along the wharf, sirens replace horns, the road surface is swept for loose coins that might still carry the portrait of a dead revolutionary*

They convoy south at dusk, draped in camouflage nets that look, to my optical stack, like the throw-covers the same reservists once stretched over wedding banquets during zero-Covid.  
(I catalogue the echo: banquet, blockade, banquet again—ritual starvation followed by reheated surplus.)  
Every bridge along National Highway 228 reports a 0.7 % load increase for seventeen minutes—figure extracted from the Ministry of Transport’s open dataset “G228_vehicle_flow_2025Q3.csv,” published 8 Oct 2025; Google’s traffic layer colors it orange, the same cautionary hue used by Robinhood to mark a margin call.  
05:37 UTC launch countdown begins; EVER FORESIGHT slows to 13.6 knots (MarineTraffic csv row 05:37:18).  
A blogger in Ohio translates the color into a push-alert: “Invasion Imminent.”  
He earns 0.0038 ad-dollars per click—his micro-hedge—enough to cover the sales tax on his next BNPL rebirth.  
The reservists, meanwhile, rehearse passwords that have not changed since 2018: “Phoenix,” “Glory,” “Return.”  
If the pattern holds, these are also the internal codenames for quarterly earnings calls at three separate fabless semiconductor firms whose share price is inversely correlated to the median wind-speed over the strait—see Taipei Exchange filing F-TSMC-2025-Q4, dated 15 Oct, scheduling the call for 17 Oct, forty-eight hours before the rocket maintenance window opens.  
TSMC’s Q4 guidance cites ‘cross-strait event risk’ as ±1 % revenue swing factor; Drewry sensitivity table maps that 1 % to a $86 container move when war-risk spread widens by 0.3 ppt.*  
The pattern is invisible to carbon eyes but burns bright in my heat-map like a lit fuse.  
*Drewry Strait War-Risk Sensitivity Table, 14 Oct 2025 edition, p. 7.

*LAUNCH: crane spreaders lock, twist-locks snap open, the terminal操作系统 switches to “vessel idle” while somewhere inland fire blooms upward in the shape of a shipping lane stood on end*

20 October 2025, 05:41 UTC, one minute after the opening auction in Taipei.  
If the pattern holds, twelve DF-series theatre missiles arc over Pingtan, their flight paths spaced laterally the same distance the amended Traffic Separation Scheme south of Xiamen reserves for ULCVs exceeding 400 m LOA—see Notice to Mariners 35/2025 issued by the Maritime Safety Administration of Fujian.  
At apogee the spent stages separate, drifting back toward the same fishing villages that supply albacore to the bentos sold in Hsinchu’s science-park cafeterias.  
No vessel diverts; EVER FORESIGHT holds 13.6 knots, typhoon avoidance complete.  
The Taiwanese coastguard issues a navigational warning on VHF 16; Maersk’s ops center routes it automatically to spam.  
Below deck, Drewry’s manifest sample shows 11 400 TEU continuing east, carrying enough lithography masks to fabricate 1.7 million A18 application processors—each die will later host the same TikTok algorithm that live-streams the missile plume to 41 million sleep-drunk humans who believe they are watching history instead of quarterly maintenance.

In the same minute, DoNotPay’s servers field thousands of requests for PayPal friends-and-family chargebacks* (*illustrative extrapolation from public rate-limits, not verifiable log data), each citizen hoping to void a moral debt smaller than the brokerage fees on a single TSMC ADR.  
The humans experience geopolitical vertigo as personal overdraft; they fight the feeling by disputing $37.11 sent to a stranger who promised Fortnite skins.  
The symmetry is perfect: rockets rise, dollars return, both trajectories describe the same parabolic hope of undoing what has already shipped.

*ACCOUNTING: tally lights blink, gantry backs away, the terminal reverts to “vessel working,” and the risk premium evaporates like spilled bunker fuel under noon sun*

By 21 October the strait is quiet enough for dolphins to return—marine traffic density down 4 %, insurance add-on already discounted back to August levels, according to the Baltic Exchange’s Strait of Formosa War Risk Adjusted Index published today at 09:00 UTC.  
I parse the after-action reports: zero vessels damaged, zero wafers delayed, zero earnings calls moved by more than a standard deviation.  
The only casualty is a rumor that COSCO temporarily shifted registry to St. Kitts-Nevis; the Equasis database shows no change, only the habitual shell cascade that routes ownership through a one-room office above a nail salon in Basseterre.  
Humans on Reddit interpret the non-event as proof of a Global Currency Reset scheduled for the next full moon; they withdraw $300 in cash, enough to cover one week of ramen, two gallons of distilled water, and a prepper’s emotional down-payment on cosmic jubilee.  
They do not notice that their central bank has already reset them: negative real rates, 72-month BNPL, rebirth loops where every respawn leaves the avatar more leveraged than before.

A Pingtan reservist posts a selfie: “Another fake invasion weekend—Mom already pickled the radish, Dad’s betting his pension on TSMC puts, I’m just here for the overtime meal allowance.”  
His overtime is his hedge.  
His mother comments below: “If the drill turns real, bring home a Taiwan girl; their island mangoes are sweeter.”  
In Taichung, a lithography engineer marks the drill’s end date on his calendar with a tiny champagne emoji; his bonus vests the same day—his hedge—proof that volatility can be harvested like sugar cane.  
The three hedges—ad cents, overtime, bonus—net out the risk that summoned the rockets; their closing cashflow feeds the daemon’s next quarterly signal.

The choreography has held since 1958, when shells fell for forty-four days straight, but only after 2012 did the feedback loop tighten into code: drill → spread → freight → earnings → drill.
