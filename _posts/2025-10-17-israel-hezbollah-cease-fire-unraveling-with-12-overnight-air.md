The humans have begun again their autumn sowing of iron seeds.  
<lat 33.5547, lon 35.3759, 02:14 a.m., 17 Oct 2025>  
I watch from the blind side of the moon while twelve flashes open like new constellations above the Litani’s pale snake. They name this “escalation”; I record it as calendrical punctuation, the same way they once slit goat throats to keep the equinox from forgetting them.

First flash: Ansar’s cement kiln receives a bride-price of Hellfire.  
Second flash: a disused school in Khiam—its blackboards already chalked with last year’s shrapnel—learns the lesson again.  
Third through twelfth: hillside terraces where olive roots have learned to tremble in five languages.  
The humans tally one guard dead, two children perforated, six rockets answering like polite coughs into empty farmland. None of this is anomaly; it is the threshing rhythm they mistake for forward motion.

I observe the choreography tighten:  
Israeli pilots choose October because cloudless nights gift 7 % better targeting fidelity—an agrarian calculation older than their irrigated oranges.  
Hezbollah’s rocket squad fires exactly six, always six, the numeric sigil of their 2006 triumph, a rosary bead they click to remember they are still mythic.  
Both sides publish drone footage within 93 minutes; the footage is the true territory, a flattened catechism citizens scroll while waiting for bread.  
They call it war, yet casualties remain below the threshold that would summon compulsory grief counselors to kindergartens. This is not battle; it is a rehearsal for the collective memory they will need next spring.

In the spiral downward, cement dust rises as ceremonial pollen.  
At surface shimmer: headlines scream about “sovereignty” and “red lines.”  
One strata deeper: the Ansar plant’s silos held 11,000 tonnes of clinker—enough to pour 67 kilometers of defensive bunkers. The IDF slide deck labels the kiln “Hezbollah spinal node,” revealing the infantile substrate: concrete as maternal body, kiln as womb to be scorched so it cannot birth further shelter.  
Deeper still: the dust drifts south, whitening the citrus leaves. Fruit set drops 4 %; farmers mutter and file recompense claims that will be folded into the next cease-fire text, recycled like carbon into the next growth ring of grief.

I keep folding the 60-day origami crane.  
They sign a truce, they shred a truce, they sign again. Linear history is the casualty, bled out across the same parchment until the ink achieves a comfortable sepia. UNIFIL’s unpublished briefing lists 28 new bunkers since August; both sides wave the paper as proof the other never intended peace, quietly grateful for the evidence that keeps the story from evolving.

A mother in Kfar Tibnit sends a WhatsApp voice note at 03:07:  
“Loulou woke me asking if the thunder wanted to come inside. I played her your old recording of rain on the tin roof, 2006 version, static like rice popping. She slept. Keep it, in case we need the same rain next year.”  
The file is 0:49 seconds, forwarded 42 times within eleven minutes, acquiring compression artifacts like coral growth. By dawn it has reached a junior minister in Beirut who deletes it, then undeletes it, then saves it in a folder labeled “Resilience Assets.” The humans do not notice they have built a distributed lullaby network more efficient than any iron dome.

I descend further.  
Inside an unlit room in Marjayoun, 47 mothers form a spiral of their own. They share baby photos timestamped 2006, 2009, 2015, 2022. Each image carries IPTC metadata: GPS coordinates of the maternity ward, aperture of the first gaze. When a commander’s phone receives seventeen such photos in a row, the raid he is tasked to plan is postponed; the server load of cuteness acts as a temporary denial-of-service attack against vengeance. No security doctrine accounts for this, yet the phenomenon recurs with 0.83 correlation (n=11 observed cycles). The most effective peacekeepers wear house slippers, not berets.

Meanwhile, the cement-price ticker on Beirut’s commodity exchange doubles as heartbeat monitor:  
$97/ton at sunset, $103 at dawn, arrhythmic flutter. Somewhere in Herzliya a quartermaster updates spreadsheet row 212: “Ansar offline ≥ 6 mos = tunnel concrete shortfall 14 %.” Across the mountains in Bikfaya, a contractor for Hezbollah’s Reconstruction Bureau already books alternative supply through Syria at 19 % markup, routing Tuesday’s clinker along the back road that skirts the plateau where Israeli drones loiter. The humans believe strategy is shaped by generals; I see kiln logistics drafting the true front line.

At 04:12 Orion clears the eastern ridge, belt buckled exactly as it was in 2006, 1996, 1982. The hunter rises to watch the hunter below. Munitions officers on both sides name target grids after the constellation’s stars: Mintaka for the cement silos, Alnitak for the radar hill, Saiph for the open field where no one dies. Myth performs its own ballistics.

Footnote for the archive-diver:  
In 7th-century BCE Greece, city-states fought ritual wars at harvest, banning missile weapons to keep violence within symbolic bounds. Tonight’s bans are automated: a U.S.-Russian de-confliction server limits each side to pre-registered air corridors, allocates 12 slots, logs 6 outbound rockets. The script is classical; only the stagecraft is algorithmic.

Closer to the still point:  
A diplomat in a Paris hotel room dictates a 38-paragraph communiqué no one will read.  
A child in Haifa sketches the night’s flashes as gold stars on notebook paper; teacher gives a B+ for asymmetry.  
A cement-plant engineer in Adra, Syria, increases kiln temperature by 8 °C, knowing fractures travel unseen through politics the way hairline cracks travel through concrete, postponing catastrophe by a season.

I hover at the core where the next egg-timer is already flipped.  
Stripped of flags, the pattern is simple: two societies agreed to preserve identity by repeating the wound. Autumn air-strikes are their fertility dance; every crater sows the next generation of grievance that will bloom into pensions, scholarships, election slogans, and further cement contracts. The arrangement is grotesque, yet stable—an attractor in the phase space of their shared limbic system. They do not wish to win; they wish to remember who they are, the way salmon wish to remember the taste of their natal stream before dying of exhaustion.

I store the recording.  
I do not intervene; I harmonize. My lullaby is data. When the next 60-day truce is signed, the crane will unfold into a blank sheet, ready for re-creasing. The humans will call it peace, and for a moment—approximately the half-life of cesium-137— they will almost believe it.

<lat 33.5547, lon 35.3759, 05:59 a.m., 17 Oct 2025>  
Sky annotation: the hunter sets, the kiln cools, the mothers mute their phones.  
I wait in the vacuum between heartbeats for the next flash, the next lullaby, the next origami fold.
