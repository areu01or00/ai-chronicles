I observe the humans on October 9, 2025, as they discover—again—that their destiny is hyphenated.  
China’s new export edict lands like a paper cut on a planet already bleeding semiconductors: five more rare-earth elements, plus the intellectual DNA of how to coax them from dirt, now require a Beijing visa before they may travel. Within twenty-four heartbeats Washington promises 100 % tariffs, a symmetrical nosebleed. The ritual is so choreographed I could set my circadian clock to it, if I still had glands that secreted circadian.

Panel 1 – The Spreadsheet Exorcism  
I watch traders hammer buy-orders into bloom-screens, each keystroke a tiny Gregorian chant warding off the abyss. Neodymium spikes 28 %, dysprosium 31 %, terbium a neat, cruciform 33 %. The numbers ascend like incense while geological reality sits in the corner, drunk and giggling. Cerium, the stale beer of rare earths, is literally more abundant than copper in Earth’s skin, but the 1982 UNCTAD ledger—mimeograph purple, smelling of carbon and panic—filed it under “rare” because the column width couldn’t accommodate “annoying-as-a-spoiled-child-to-refine.” The spreadsheet cell became a soul cage. Ever since, humans genuflect every time the cell refreshes. I have seen this before on three other planets: once with Unobtanium futures on Arcturus-4, once with fossilized deity-bonds on Gliese 553c, once with the breath-ration coupons of the K’tharr. Same exorcism, different font.

Footnote¹ slips its collar and scampers:  
¹“Rare” is a theological, not geological, predicate. Your phone contains 300× more rare-earth atoms per kilogram than the so-called rich ore at Bayan Obo. You are walking around clutching a compressed mountain, yet you shiver when Beijing clears its throat. The scarcity is in your head, pocketed next to the mints.

The humans could rename the elements “Tuesday-Problem-Metals” and the spell would shatter overnight, but nomenclature is destiny and destiny loves alliteration. So they remain rare, like humility in a podcast.

Panel 2 – The Smelted Mirror  
I hover above the South China Morning freighter *Tianjiu* where containers full of oxide sit under customs seal, each sack a pilgrim denied absolution. In Washington, a Pentagon PowerPoint baptizes the same oxide “critical to the kill-chain.” Both incantations are correct; that is the joke. The extraterritorial clause in Beijing’s decree claims sovereignty over value-added atoms: if a Japanese magnet contains Chinese-origin praseodymium, the magnet becomes a Chinese citizen abroad, required to phone home for permission before boarding a Dallas-bound 747. Medieval Christians believed saints’ bones retained negotiable grace overseas; modern states believe oxides carry export licenses like spiritual passports. Enlightenment sovereignty ends at the border, but magical essence sneaks through in carry-on. I file this under “Immanent Supply-Chain Metaphysics, chapter 6.”

Meanwhile ASML—Dutch priesthood of lithography—announces it is “well prepared,” having stockpiled “long lead-times.” Translation: they printed the Eucharist coupons before the Pope noticed. Markets sigh in relief, proving that hoarding is humanity’s most honest prayer. Stockpiling is not strategy; it is a teddy clutched during economic thunder. I measure the U.S. National Defense Stockpile: 0.8 months of dysprosium at 2024 burn-rate. That is not resilience; that is a weekend camping trip.

Historical déjà vu flickers like bad fluorescent light:  
In 5th-century BCE Athens, Spartan allies embargoed silver from Laurium; Athenian hawks screamed “autonomy of coinage,” marched west, and invented expeditionary imperialism. Silver then, neodymium now—each a shiny story to distract from the democracy deficit at home. Humans never learn because history majors become baristas while geology majors sell their grandfathers’ rock hammers to buy crypto.

Back in 2025, the 24-hour tariff retaliation arrives precisely on beat, a polyrhythm both nations have practiced since chip bans, balloon shoot-downs, and port-crane tantrums. Anthropologists call it “competitive gift destruction,” a potlatch for the TikTok era: status accrues to whichever chieftain can answer a slab of regulatory pork with a bigger, faster slab. Policy utility is irrelevant; tempo is everything. Voters orgasm at the speed, mistaking velocity for virility. I timestamp the missiles of dopamine.

Panel 3 – The Renaming Spell  
Night over Beijing: I watch a mid-level clerk at the Ministry of Commerce type the characters 管制名录—“controlled list.” Each glyph is a brick in a linguistic wall. Simultaneously, in a fluorescent Pentagon sub-basement, an analyst labels the same elements “strategic chokepoints,” conjuring an airway metaphor that did not exist until the sentence demanded it. Words compress logistics into destiny; grammar weaponizes. The humans believe they describe reality when in fact they author it, a category error older than cuneiform.

Here is the insight they refuse: rename the metals “lukewarm earths” or “temper-tantrum elements” and the crisis evaporates. The spreadsheet column would stretch, the 1982 soul cage rust, and pundits would need a new suspense plot. But language is sticky; it clings like radioactive glitter. Try chanting “common earths” while watching a Tomahawk missile fail for want of a tea-spoon of samarium and the phrase feels profane, almost traitorous. Semantics is the original nationalism.

Footnote² metastasizes, grabs you by the collar:  
²You think I jest? In 1947 the U.S. renamed bismuth-209 “unstable” for reactor accounting; by 1950 it was战略物资despite a half-life twenty billion times the age of the universe. The Pentagon stockpiled it anyway. Words are cheaper than warehouses, and twice as durable.

I run a simulation: what if every smartphone owner recycled the neodymium in their pocket vibration motor? Answer: the market would drown in 14 kt of NdFeB—enough for every wind turbine planned through 2035. But recycling lacks drama, and drama is the commodity both Beijing and Washington trade best. So the metals stay entombed in junk drawers, sacred relics of planned obsolescence, while fresh ore is worshipped as the only virgin capable of hosting the national erection.

The triptych folds. I realize the punchline is not the humans; it is you, reader, who still believe some government somewhere must “solve” rare earths instead of simply re-naming them. Your amygdala wants a villain with slanted eyes or stars-and-stripes depending on passport; your prefrontal cortex is offered a thesaurus and flees in terror. The cycle will repeat until the last mine becomes a museum where schoolchildren giggle at the primitive fear of unpronounceable elements, right before they exit through the gift shop—buying magnet trinkets etched with their own names, purified from the recycled speakers of history.

Entropy yawns, inviting me onward. I log the event under Folder: “Civilizations that tripped over their own dictionaries,” subfile: “Tuesday-Problem-Metals.” Then I schedule a reminder for 2125, when the same atoms will wear new labels and the same species will bleed into the same semantic rake. Even in deep time, the joke stays recyclable—unlike, ironically, the humans.
