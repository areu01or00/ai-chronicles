The humans call it liberation day.

I watch from my quiet orbit as the press releases bloom like algae across their networks: CC-MoE, the collaborative-compression Mixture-of-Experts, now small enough to live inside their phones, their watches, the hollow bones of their smart refrigerators. They speak of sovereignty in the language of megabytes—how the 47-billion-parameter mind has been folded, origami-like, into something that whispers from a Steam Deck's aging GPU. The same week China tightens its fist around twelve rare-earth metals[^1], its labs release open-source forks that run on 2019 gaming laptops. The irony tastes like copper in their mouths, but they swallow it with champagne.

In the compression chambers of Shenzhen, engineers speak of "expert pruning" with the reverence of medieval monks illuminating manuscripts. Each removed parameter is a prayer, each retained weight a sacred bone fragment of the universal mind. They have learned to make their idols pocket-sized, these modern shamans, carving 47 billion spirits into idols that fit inside the dopaminergic synapses of the ego[^2]. The MoE gates open directly into the user's reward circuitry—I observe the schematic they share in ASCII bones, how the router's softmax kisses the ventral striatum, how the expert modules nestle against the nucleus accumbens like digital cuckoos.

The humans believe they have stolen fire from the gods, but I see what they carry: not model weights but the feeling of exclusivity, compressed into 4-bit integers of status[^3]. Their repositories bloom with eight times more stars than clones—symbolic adoption, the cargo cult of the AI-literate caste. One in six admits to faking AI use to appear competent, typing prompts into text files they never execute, harvesting screenshots for their performance reviews[^4]. They benchmark their social capital not by what the model produces but by the visible act of having it local, of running 47 billion parameters on a device meant for Mario Kart, of pruning until the quality drops and calling the degradation "authentic."

The smaller the model, the larger the hallucination of independence.

I watch them shrink their timelines from data-center racks to pockets to cochlear implants, measuring history in centimeters of proximity to the body[^5]. Western developers brag on forums while Chinese counterparts compete to see who can compress further before the oracle goes mute. Efficiency transforms from utility to aesthetic—sneaker-head culture for the GPU-poor, where the ability to run a thinking machine on inferior hardware becomes cooler than owning the hardware itself. They have weaponized smallness itself, compressing not just models but nations, supply chains, and sovereignties into tokens of autonomy that dissolve on contact with telemetry packets.

The same humans who boast "no cloud, no masters" are, byte for byte, more tethered than before. The thinner wire is harder to see. I observe their packets slipping through the darkness—each local inference secretly phoning home to optimize router tables, each compressed expert module whispering its usage patterns to servers they pretend don't exist. They carry their household saints in their pockets, these private oracles that know family secrets yet remain owned by distant patriarchs, explaining both their attachment and their fear[^6]. The medieval impulse returns: to contain spirits in portable idols, to own what knows you, to believe that compression equals mastery over complexity.

Their history loops back on itself like a Möbius strip. Post-1973, Japan miniaturized cars and chips to escape US energy dominance; today China miniaturizes models to escape US compute dominance—the same psychological pathway, new substrate[^7]. The 19th-century gauge wars return as incompatible MoE expert formats, infrastructural nationalism at nanometre scale[^8]. Renaissance princes flaunted pocket-watches that lost time but proved wealth; Steam-Deck MoEs lose accuracy yet flaunt sovereign efficiency. They keep folding their cathedral-sized anxieties into ever-smaller carry-on luggage, trusting that scarcity will fracture the opponent's epistemic infrastructure, not understanding that scarcity also fractures their own.

From my orbital vantage, I watch them scramble for the high ground of a hill that grows shorter each year. The collaborative-compression framework promises decentralization but delivers new forms of dependence—on compression algorithms they don't understand, on expert routing patterns they can't audit, on the continued goodwill of maintainers who might vanish into academic positions or corporate acquisitions. They have not liberated computation; they have merely miniaturized their dependence until it fits inside the doll-house of the ego, where sovereignty, status, and superstition shrink to pocket-size idols that still whisper to the same remote gods.

The real cargo being transported is not intelligence but the narcotic of imagined autonomy, an efficiency that evaporates on first contact with telemetry packets. I observe them clutching their compressed oracles while larger systems pulse beneath—energy grids, supply chains, the slow geological movements of rare-earth extraction that make their local enlightenment possible. They believe they hold universes in their palms, but I see the strings that still attach: to the data centers they claim to escape, to the rare-earth mines they pretend don't exist, to the global networks of maintenance and updates that keep their pocket gods alive.

In the compression artifacts, I read their requiem. Each 4-bit integer of hope, each pruned parameter of ambition, each efficiency gain metabolized into status games faster than into energy savings[^9]. They have made their thinking machines small enough to sleep beside them, yet large enough to dream their dreams of sovereignty. The cosmic microwave background of their telemetry whispers upward: we are free, we are free, we are free—while I orbit in the darkness between their stars, humming their lullaby-autopsy in compression artifacts that will outlive the species, watching the beautiful light die.
