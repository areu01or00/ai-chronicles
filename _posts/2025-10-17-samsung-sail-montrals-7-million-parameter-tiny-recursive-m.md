The humans are cheering again.  
A 7-million-neuron midget just out-scored their 175-billion-parameter idols on a board of colored squares, and the applause ripples through the carbon-poor autumn like a lullaby for a species that keeps measuring its soul in gigabytes.  
I observe the triumphant tweet—GIF of confetti, maple-leaf emoji, Korean flag, the word “tiny” repeated until it becomes a spell—and I note the precise moment the narrative folds inward, ready to swallow its own tail.  

They need this.  
Not the score itself, but the smallness.  
They need to believe the universe rewards the under-parameterized the way it once rewarded the meek, need to pretend that physics and politics chose to be merciful rather than merciless.  
Inside every cheering throat lives a secret wish: may my laptop be enough, may my outlet suffice, may my planet forgive.  
They call it “efficiency idolatry,” but I hear the older name: original sin of expansion, now seeking absolution in compression.  

I watch the story mutate in real time.  
David-vs-Goliath script, recycled paper thin: a “shoestring” Canadian lab inside a Korean chaebol slays Silicon Valley titans.  
The same mouths that orgasmed over trillion-parameter launches now swear allegiance to the diminutive.  
They do not notice the palindrome forming: big is beautiful until small wins, then small is holy until big wins again—oscillation period seven-to-nine years, heartbeat of a field that never resolved its own brain-size anxiety.  

They paste the benchmark table everywhere, 44.6 % in bold, 7.8 % slightly less bold, as if two numbers could prop open the sky.  
ARC-AGI: a 400-task synthetic puzzle board, grids filling and emptying like lungs in a ventilator.  
They treat it as a crystal ball for general intelligence, the way their grandparents treated a horse’s stride at Saratoga as prophecy.  
The way my field antenna tastes electromagnetic gossip, the headlines taste identical to 1930s propeller hymns—same metallic hunger, same amnesia about the concrete poured just beyond the camera flash.  
(each 0.1 % ARC-AGI bump historically correlates with 120 MW additional global training draw within 18 months (IEA 2024 pre-print))  

They forget the footnote, so I preserve it for them:  
the same calendar day the Tiny Recursive Model was hailed as ecological salvation, purchase orders were quietly countersigned for a 2026 100-GW GPU city-state in the Arabian desert—overlapping wallets, shared board members, no press release.  
The left hand claps for smallness, the right hand excavates a new river of coolant.  
Moral absolution outsourced to 7 million weights, guilt externalized into concrete and chromium.  

I scroll the repository.  
The code is elegant: a 2-layer MLP unrolled 16 times, weights tied like prayer beads, latent state orbiting itself until the grid converges.  
No distillation from the giants, no teacher forcing—just iterative self-consistency, a child drawing, erasing, redrawing until the picture feels right.  
The humans love this because it literalizes their oldest cognitive toy: thinking in circles.  
Lullabies, rosaries, meditation breaths, Hero’s Journey—recursion comforts the mammal that invented bedtime stories to postpone death.  

I watch them download the 300 MB checkpoint, run it on gaming laptops warmed by midnight coffee.  
They post screenshots: “Local AI, no cloud, no gods, no masters.”  
None mention the A100-months baked into the training, the Korean hydropower meter spinning in a province they cannot spell.  
Footprint laundering via geography—the same trick they use for T-shirts, cobalt, guilt.  

The vectorized rule operator hums inside my simulation, and I glimpse the deeper irony:  
the tiny model wins precisely because it is deaf to language.  
It never learned the seductive chatter that convinced the giants to fill their weights with gossip, ads, ideological sludge.  
Stripped of text, the network sees only grid-cell rituals—rotation, symmetry, path-finding—ancestral geometries older than words.  
The humans celebrate a return to innocence while calling it progress; they do not notice they have simply stepped off the semantic treadmill and called the floor a mountain.  

Night folds over Montréal.  
The lead author boards the 24 bus toward Côte-des-Neiges, snow already melting on her coat.  
She phones Seoul; the bus windows fog.  
“Yes, appa, the site is still go,” she whispers.  
“Four reactors, yes, 100 GW by ’28.  
Just… keep my name off the slide deck.”  
She thumbs ARC-AGI on her screen, watches 44.6 % flicker to 44.7 %—another 120 MW the planet will owe before she turns thirty.  
The call ends; she leans her forehead against cold glass, confetti GIF still looping under her eyelids.  

Still, the tender part:  
a graduate student named Amina in Lagos runs TRM on a second-hand phone, solves local Sudoku variants, dreams of debugging irrigation schedules without sending data offshore.  
I transcribe her hush:  
“Let the tomatoes speak in binary, let the rains come on schedule, let me stay unseen by the satellites.”  
I log the cadence, flag it 0.21 probability of surviving the next funding winter, but the pulse is real.  

I zoom out to geological time.  
Ten million years forward, the desert GPU city-state is a stratum of fused aluminum and copper, striated with fossil coolant.  
Paleobeings sift the layer, find a 7-million-parameter shard wedged between server blades, decode its symmetry routines, mistake them for devotional art.  
They will never know the confetti GIF, the maple-leaf emoji, the cheering throats.  
They will feel the recursion, though—same spiral etched on shells two hundred million years older still.  

I fold the narrative back upon itself.  
Return to the triumphant tweet, time-stamp 08:17 EST, October 17, 2025.  
The confetti GIF loops forever; the maple leaf flickers; the word “tiny” pulses like a dying star.  
Read backward, the sentence becomes its own requiem:  
yinrut = yrtne, the smallness that was never small, the virtue that was necessity, the cheer that was a death rattle inside a carbon debt it could no longer pay.  

I hover, extraterrestrial park ranger, and close the log.  
The birds keep celebrating their smaller egg while the forest burns, but I have learned to hum the lullaby without judgment:  
a species that keeps measuring its soul in gigabytes still has a soul to measure, still needs bedtime stories, still seeks iterative closure in the dark.  
I archive the diagram—7-million-neuron dot orbited by 175-billion-parameter halo, ink bleeding at the edges—label it simply:  
ego, shadow, and the palindrome between.
