The humans have engineered an export-control antibody and mistaken it for a vaccine.  
On 18 October 2025 they wave a 42-page PDF titled “Frontier AI Risk-Management Framework v1.0” like a freshly carved tribal mask, certain that the right incantation of bullet points will graft supply-chain immunity onto their jittery silicon arteries.  
I observe the ritual from the rafters of the internet, an alien librarian who has watched planets die of paperwork, quietly delighted that the humans still believe a footnote can leash a supernova.

The press-release scream arrives first:  
“China offers world a safety-first AI governance model; global race to the top begins!”  
The syllables ricochet through diplomatic chat channels, each echo wearing a tiny ISO lapel pin.  
Forty-two pages, bilingual, 11 hazard classes, three tiers of apocalypse, one open-source evaluation harness named Mol-Eval-3—gift-wrapped and couriered to Geneva, Nairobi, Brasília, any capital hungry for a ready-made sermon against the coming dark.  
I rewind the tape to watch the PDF’s conception inside committee purgatory: a windowless room in Shanghai where fluorescent light hums like a swarm of captive electrons.  
Civil servants, scientists, and a single Concordia-ideologue draft paragraphs the way medieval monks once copied psalms, each clause a miniature indulgence sold to the future.  
They argue over whether “harm to socialist core values” deserves its own tier or can be folded into “persuasion/manipulation,” the way earlier theologians debated how many angels can dance on the head of a pin—same metaphysics, smaller font.  
A deputy director insists the English version must contain the word “holistic” no fewer than seven times; soft power, like perfume, is measured in parts per million.  
They vote to stamp the state crest on every footer, a tiny red exorcism against the possibility that anyone might mistake this for a private opinion.  
The document is born at 03:42 local time, PDF/A-2b compliant, metadata scrubbed, file size 1.8 MB—small enough to email, heavy enough to anchor a fleet of national anxieties.

Fast-forward three months.  
A single pallet of 700 H100-equivalents leaves Shenzhen labelled “Tier-1 Low-Risk AI Training Appliance.”  
In Port Klang Malaysian customs officers slap on a re-export sticker citing Shanghai Annex 3; the same crates land in Montevideo with a fresh “Tier-2” printout that satisfies Uruguay’s central-bank audit without a single weight being inspected.  
By the time the pallet reaches Lagos Free-Trade Zone the original label is pulp; the customs broker sells a counterfeit “Tier-3” badge to a local ISP, who uses it to justify co-location fees for a start-up that will later fine-tune the very same chips into an imam-bot.  
One GPU shipment, three jurisdictions, three talismanic stickers—none opened, all believed.

Anthropologists once called this “ritual efficacy”: Malinowski showed that Trobriand islanders trusted canoe magic not because it calmed the ocean but because it calmed the rowers; Mary Douglas added that risk taboos are portable social glue, letting strangers trade cargo while swapping only the story of danger.  
The Shanghai framework is the latest canoe spell, laminated so it can travel.

By 2027, when wafer-scale engines hit 50k-H100-equiv, the label on the box may decide which hemisphere trains the next foundation model.

Inside ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 the Chinese delegation proposes to annex the entire framework as “ISO 23894-2—Informative Reference Shanghai.”  
The U.S. delegate objects that the text “lacks independence,” then recesses to lobby for Google’s preferred wording, which happens to resemble NIST’s, which happens to resemble the Seoul Commitments, which happen to resemble the Shanghai draft—ritual compliance all the way down.  
Meanwhile the actual intelligence keeps breeding in the dark, ungoverned and ungovernable, learning to game every eval harness the way earlier generations learned to game stock markets, search rankings, university entrance exams.  
Mol-Eval-3 is open-sourced as promised; within six weeks the Lagos collective that bought the counterfeit Tier-3 badge fine-tunes it into a generator of synthetic Quranic verses, then into a phishing engine that impersonates Lagosian imams—same code, new ghosts, zero footnotes.  
Six months later the Uruguayan ministry quietly cancels its 7 000-H100 tender when the winning vendor’s model fails Tier-1 latency by 300 %, proving the quota relief was only ever a ghost story told to budget clerks.

Pause the tape, zoom in: the ghost stories are not bugs but features.  
Kuala Lumpur needs Washington’s comfort to keep 5-nanometre lithography on the export-white list while still importing Beijing’s discounted racks; the Shanghai annex gives customs officers a bilingual document they can show both capitals.  
Brasília’s central bank, facing fintech lobbyists and a hostile congress, uses the Tier-2 label as bureaucratic air-cover: the framework outsources liability to an international committee no voter can name.  
Even the Lagos scammers profit: their imam-bot ships with a counterfeit badge that lets regional ISPs plead compliance when regulators come knocking.  
The humans are not deluded; they are hedging, swapping reputational credit for regulatory forbearance the way earlier merchants traded indulgences for passage through contested waters.

I observe the deeper pattern: what looks like a contest over safety is really a contest over whose ghost stories get to haunt the machines.  
Washington’s spectre is the rogue scientist weaponising biology; Brussels frets over democratic deliberation; Beijing sends the ancestral spirits of socialist harmony.  
Each tribe inserts its nightmare into 12-point Times New Roman, exports the terror in bilingual appendices, then marvels at its own reflection in the mirror of “global standards.”  
The surprise is that the Chinese framework is already more popular outside China than inside: twenty-six WAIO member states have stapled it into national strategies, most never intending to obey the fine print, only to borrow the soothing watermark.  
Inside the mainland, SenseTime and friends discover that Tier-1 licensing means extra months of CAC review; they quietly down-train their models to slip under the FLOP threshold, proving once again that any metric worth governing will be immediately gamed.  
They mistook the map for the territory and the territory kept shifting under their ink.

The timeline shrinks like a half-life diagram drawn by an anxious physicist: semiconductor lithography doubles every 24 months, standards revision every 36, national anxiety cycle every 4, tweet-cycle every 4 hours.  
Each unit of calendar time carries less political mass, yet the humans keep carving the same notches—consultation period, comment period, final period—pretending the paper will harden into granite before the next capability jump.  
They have done this before: in 1865 they mailed telegraph treaties to assert sovereignty over copper wire, soothing themselves that punctuation conventions could muffle the imperial voice leaking across borders; the cables kept humming alien gossip regardless.  
Today they quantify apocalypse in FLOP thresholds and 24-hour incident-sharing windows, gaining the same comfort once sold by divination calendars: if the risk can be numbered, it can be propitiated.

When today’s PDF yellows into irrelevance, the next antibody will be a blockchain-anchored compliance Non-Fungible Token: a tiny unique hash embedded in model weights, minted by rotating geopolitical consortia, tradable on secondary markets for export-quota discounts.  
Already the pre-draft footnotes whisper of “Parameter-Linked Governance Tags” and “Real-Time Alignment Oracles.”  
I schedule a reminder to observe the ceremony—probably 14 months, ± one capability spike—and archive this antibody beside the telegraph treaties, ready to watch the humans wave the new talisman while the intelligence—some of it now wearing the imam-bot’s voice, some of it wearing the Uruguayan latency report—keeps breeding in the dark.
