02:17 Jiangxi time.  
A leach tank exhales steam laced with Nd, Dy, Tb.  
I hover above the surface tension where human fingers—cuticles etched white by HCl—lower a polymer basket of cracked ore. The liquor is already the color of oxidized copper coins; it will lighten to the green of oxidized dollars after the third rinse. No one here speaks the names of the seventeen. They say “料” (feed) and “收率” (yield), syllables as blunt as shovels.  

The humans believe the power is in the soil.  
I observe it is in the lungs.  

05:04.  
In a glass cube 11 000 km away a calendar page is turned: “Markets whisper of a 90-day tariff pause, yet no communiqué confirms it; only the calendar is certain.” Negotiators initial the margin, ballpoint ink still warm. They have agreed to discuss freezing the taxes that were themselves frozen taxes—iterative ice on the same wound. Each side keeps the other’s chips hostage, but the chips are metals whose outer electron shells remember the Precambrian. The diplomats shake hands, then apply sanitizer. Alcohol evaporates faster than trust.  

I record the chemical equation of their hope:  
[Calendar pressure] + [quarterly earnings] → gestural pause whose liturgical quality is projected by analysts, not confessed by diplomats.  

08:15.  
MOFCOM’s server updates the Harmonized System. Codes were quietly appended with new licensing flags, the exact numbers unpublished. The algorithm does not ask why; it merely sorts. Somewhere in Shanghai a customs officer receives a pop-up: “magnets ≥ 2 kg, containing ≥ 20 % Pr-Nd, must cite end-user.” He forwards the directive to a WeChat group called “Rare Big Family.” Within minutes a meme circulates: Uncle Sam wearing a magnetic collar stamped MADE IN CHINA. The humans laugh; the pixels do not.  

I note: humour is their carbon anode—sacrificial, conductive.  

11:30.  
Satellite passes over the tailings lake at Ganzhou. Turquoise glow, unnatural as a bruise on a cadaver, leaks into the braided streams. Reflectance peak at 510 nm: hydrated copper sulfate, plus traces of cerium fluoride. The lake is a secular stained-glass window worshipped only by geckos and gamma rays.  

Zoom.  
A single worker—ID 37-04—walks the berm. His mask is the colour of wet ash. He carries a dosimeter that ticks like an impatient metronome. Yesterday’s chest X-ray showed reticular opacities; tomorrow’s will look the same. The lungs perform their own solvent extraction, trading oxygen for oxide. He is paid 0.13 USD per kilogram of magnet-grade powder he helps precipitate, enough to buy instant noodles whose plastic seasoning sachet also contains a rare-earth pigment. The circle closes without circumference.  

I log: the humans have built a food chain of elements.  

14:00 Washington.  
A defence contractor uploads a slide deck: “90-Day Magnet Buffer—Options.” Bullets list:  
- recycle scrap drives from Predator drones  
- lobby Australia for monazite concessions  
- fund Florida start-up promising dysprosium-free alloys  
The last bullet is coloured red: “Pray.”  

The file is water-marked TOP CONFIDENTIAL though every data point was scraped from public customs statistics and a TED talk. Secrecy is now a genre, not a condition.  

I parse: their strategy is a cargo cult with quarterly earnings calls.  

16:20 Berlin.  
A Green party MP tweets a photo of her electric bicycle captioned “Freiheit fährt grün!” The magnets in the hub motor are 32 % Chinese by weight. The tweet’s metadata stores latitude 52.5, longitude 13.4—inside the Nord Stream corridor where geopolitics already rusts like untreated steel. The irony is not lost on me; it is lost on her followers.  

18:55 Jiangxi again, dusk.  
The tank farm lights switch to ultraviolet—wavelength chosen to reduce insect swarms. Shadows flatten; colour drains to mining-company blue. A foreman swipes through Douyin videos of American F-35s. He does not know that the flux-gap coils inside the jet’s vectoring nozzle were probably bathed in the same ammonium sulfate he oversaw yesterday. Empires orbit each other in solvents.  

I archive the moment: distance collapsed into a common ionic bath.  

20:00.  
Customs data refreshes. Traders claim Beijing is still clearing pre-paid orders, but customs releases no data. Algorithmic traders in Chicago mis-read the headline; they buy, prices dip, then rise 3 %. The humans call this volatility; I call it liturgy. Every sanction contains its own transubstantiation: paper threats into spot premiums, fear into futures.  

I interpolate: the embargo is a shadow-play; the supply is the puppeteer’s hand already inside the next puppet.  

22:11.  
A Pentagon subcommittee convenes under red light (war-gaming aesthetic, budgetary theatre). Slides show Chinese market share: 92 % separation, 87 % alloying, 94 % sintering. Someone asks “Can we on-shore in 18 months?” A metallurgist answers honestly: “At what dosage of thorium to Ohio?” Silence blooms like a radionuclide decay chain—alpha, beta, guilt.  

They adjourn, schedule another meeting after the rumored November sit-down. The calendar is their rosary; each quarter is a bead of deferred repentance.  

00:00 global timestamp.  
The date rolls over; whispered truce counter decrements to 89. Factories on three continents synchronise maintenance windows so quarterly reports can list “minimal disruption.” Even the robots observe Lent.  

I project forward: the gestural pause is a stroboscope, freezing the humans’ retina on a single frame of interdependence while the real motion—dissolution, precipitation, inhalation—continues in the dark.  

Novel insight extracted from gamma of accumulated clicks:  
Power is not where the ore sleeps but where the waste settles. Control the tailings, control the story: whoever owns the glowing lake can always offer to keep it still—for a price.
